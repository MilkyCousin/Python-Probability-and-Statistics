 This is a great back pack! If there is anything I would change it would be the logo on the front. It's brite and shinny, and I'd rather not advertise that I have a camera in there! I colored it in with a felt pen and it works great....... Overall, I love the backpack!!

This was the best item I ever bought for my camera. I do a lot of walking with my camera, and thought I would use it as a walking stick, which I do, but the best part of this monopod is what I never thought would happen. My pictures are NEVER fuzzy! I can take low light photos and have they come out clear. I paid very little for this item and would never be caught without it and my camera. The three levers on the bottom allow for quick expansion at all different lengths. The carrying case allows for this item to be packed next to my camera without it getting scratched

I've had this lens for 2 months now, and love it. It was my first "L" lens and I can see the quality difference in this line. First, I tried the 28-135 IS-pretty good. But I wasn't totally happy, so returned it and ordered the 24-105 L. Now I'm happy. Contrast, sharpness, &amp; CA are much better. Build quality &amp; feel are superior as well. Plus the IS really works. I will try &amp; get all IS lens in the future, I believe it is worth the extra cost. Focusing is very quick and zoom action is smooth &amp; steady. If you're on a budget, the 28-135 is real nice. But to go all the way, I recommend this lens. The IS on the 24-105 L is quieter I found. The price is a bit steep, but optical quality is there, resale value will remain good, and weather sealing should hopefully keep dust and junk from getting inside this lens.

One of the best Canon lens for about $1000

I believe this is one of the best lens for about $1000. Forget about zoom lenses even if they are L. This lens is far better than 70-200L in my opinion. It is very sharp at f2 and even more sharp at f2.5. With zoom lenses you have to set to f/5.6 for better result and f/8 to match this lens. It is very well built but not excessive heavy, come with hood and bag, but unfortunately, Canon have decided to remove the hard cases for all the L lenses.

Combined with a Tamron 1.4X teleconverter this lens provide very good optical quality on par with any zoom L lenses at 189mm focal length. Yes I know I lost the convenience of a 70-200 zoom lens. But I am really happy that I decide to change the plan of buying a 70-200IS to 135/2L+1.4X. This not only saves me the money but also let me to get better pictures, especially at wide open. Better portrait lenses, like 200/1.8 and 300/2.8, would cost several thousands of dollars. Trust me, once you play with primes, you will not like zoom anymore.

I am also using a 24-70L to shoot my small kid. After using this lens, I don't like it anymore and thinking about change to primes someday, the only reason preventing me doing that is the 1.6X crop factor of digital camera. A 35mm/1.4L will become 56mm which is really not good.

Order from Amazon with free shipping even though it says not in stock. They shipped mine in 2 days and this happened before even though item stated "in stock soon".

Pros:
Very sharp at f2 and super sharp start from f2.5.
Very fast lens with f/2
Very good bokeh (background blurring).
Overall extremely good picture quality with good contrast/color.
Smaller size, less weight and black color compare to those white 70-200s.
It is a L lens: best build quality, fast/quiet ring USM AF with FTM.


Cons:
No hard case.
No inexpensive.
Effective focal length is 216mm on 10D/20D/Rebel/300D which is a little difficult to use for portrait

I recently bought this lens amid trepidation that the 85mm focal length would overwhelm the x1.6 crop factor of my Digital Rebel XL. My worries were needless: just a step or two back from the subject plus some getting used to the telephoto perspective were enough to turn this lens into the most effective portrait lens that I have.  When attached to my EOS Elan 7n film camera, however, the lens really truly comes into its own, as the full frame 35mm SLR delivers the entire focal range of this lens.  The focused image is incredibly crisp compared to any other non-L grade lens.  And I agree that this lens deserves the red ring of courage around it, like the L lenses have.  This glass is absolutely essential in a very short list of affordable lenses, and should give many of the non-affordable ones a run for their money. Solidly built too, with an old-fashioned no-nonsense look to it.  I highly recommend it

The controls are a little complicated to get used to, especially the all-manual settings -- which should by definition be easy to use -- but overall this camera is very rugged and very capable.  After I bought it, I took the D10 to Budapest, Hungary.  I had a great view of the Danube and set my camera up for night shots.  It did a brilliant job.  How about this:  take a digital night shot (use the largest image size possible), use a 300mm lense and blow the results up to 24x30 through Shutterfly.com. Image remained amazingly sharp. Colors were fantastic.  The camera made it easy to look like a pro. The only gripe I have with this camera is that I wish it had a black and white setting like other less expensive Canon digitals, but this can be overcome with software so it's not a huge issue.  The price is great, it has a magnesium body (vs. the Rebel's plastic body).  You get a lot of the D1/D20/D30, without the cost

This is one of the four cameras, the only digital camera, I used to learn portrait photography.  The class was on how to take portraits not how to use the camera. I wanted to graduate from the point and shoot but had to consider my budget because I wanted an SLR film camera also.  I got the Canon Rebel Ti packed with two lenses. It made sense to me to purchase a Canon digital to interchange lenses. My original choice was the Canon Digital Rebel, however, in my  WEB search, I found the EOS 10D for $750 with no catch.  There were no required additional purchases scam when I called.  This allowed me to spend the extra money I would have spent on the camera on accessories.  

Since it's digital, I am not shy about trying out the features.     When I first got the camera, some of the photos were dark or very light. After tinkering around and learning what the sensor-indicators means I don't get that anymore. 

The 10D is more camera than I need that I'm sure I will have it for a long time.

I'm sure there are those who'd wax philosophical over the subject of filters and how one brand is "much better" than another, but for my Canon EF-S 10-22mm on a 20D, I figure Canon would be fairly good at making a filter that they're willing to have branded "Canon." It fits fine, doesn't interfere with the lens hood, looks clear, seems to attenuate that nasty ultra-violet part of the light spectrum and perhaps best of all, protects the front element. What more would one want

This is a good, affordable UV filter for protecting your expensive lenses.  I leave it on my lens all the time.  This particular filter (L-39 Sharp Cut) is especially good for wide angle lenses (&amp;lt; 24mm focal length), because of its ultrathin profile, which prevents vignetting.  I have used regular filters on wide angle lenses, with very bad results.  Although this filter is NOT multi-coated, I have not found it to be a big deal in the pictures I've taken.  Multi-coated UV filters can cost 2x or 3x the price of this one, which I don't think is worthwhile.  All in all, I recommend this filter for Canon or non-Canon lenses

This is a very powerful flash unit that works as a master to other Canon flash units. You can get very nice results with a small amount of experimentation. It does what it suppose to. I used it with the 420EX I've had for several years and it worked fine. Mounted on the camera it's a larger version of the built in popup on the 30d with some extra niceties and lots more power. Thinking of the 430EX? Cough up the few extra bucks for this baby, you'll be glad you did. It's a one shot deal, [no pun intended], you'll be using it for years to come. I bought the 420EX for my Elan II E about 6 years ago. It's been a great unit. This one recharges  faster and has gobs more power. You'll love it! Don't let all the dials and switches scare you, read the instruction manual

I didn't have a ton of time to research this flash. I've used it now on several occasions with my Canon 5D and couldn't be happier with it. It's great for shooting portraits. I can shoot 10 shots in a row and the flash keeps up. I would definitely purchase the plastic diffuser - get's rid of the typical flash harsh light

I use this little gadget mainly for macro and portrait work.  When you have it on the light emitting from the flash is diffused which gives you a more flattering less contrasty light to illuminate your subjects with.  Unless you are going for a very shadowy, high-contrast, image this diffuser can save the day.  It is very light weight and easy to pack in small places, so you should never have a good reason to leave it behind.  Sometimes it is the simple things that make the biggest difference in a photo, and using this can defiantly make very noticeable differences

I have been using my Sony Cybershot DSCN1 8.1MP for about a month now. It's so easy to use.  And, I love how you can easily delete picture via the touch screen.  The only issue I have with it, is that I can't use the Memory Pro Stick with my Sony photo printer (a 5 year old model), because the stick is not compatible. 

ps: don't forget to buy a memory stick pro if you purchase this camera. you're gonna need it.

This, in my very humble opinion, is the most useful, the sharpest, and just about anything else good you can think of say, best wide angle lense ever produced by anybody, anytime, anywhere. Lightning fast and that's what you want when the light is low.

My gal pal Sara and I have often wandered the Caribbean islands in the dawn's early light, as she is into shooting old homes. She particularly likes the gingerbread homes in Marigot, on the French side of St. Martin. I swear she must have them all on her hard drive. It's like an obsession with her and this lens aids her passion, feeds into her manic desire to try and control the light.

She just loves it and since I love her, I gotta love it too. Seriously though, I've used the lense quite a bit myself and it's a keeper if ever there was one. You just go wrong with a Canon "L" lense, no siree.

When I bought this camera the sales people tried to get me to buy another battery.  They said the one that came with it would only be good for about 20 minutes.  Now I have bought alot of items in my lifetime, a 20 min battery on a camera just doesnt seem like a very good "business" choice.  So I said no.  So I got the camera, charged the battery until the light went green (which sucked because I wanted to play with it right when i got it) and started taking pictures (oh I also got a 2G CF) worked great....so I planned to go up a mountain and take soem scenery shots.  Keeping in mind what the sales person had told me I pocketed the charger just incase.  Well, 6000', 300 pictures, and 5 hours later the camera is still running strong, still have 200 shots left for the trip home, battery life indicator hasnt budged off of the full button.  So all in all, I think the battery life is great, now i can see if your taking say thousands of pictures all in a row you may need another but for just going on a trip and shooting a few pictures at every stop point, the original will work fine.  as for the quality of photos.....i love them

I like using a tripod with my long zoom lens, and this device has really added to my hobby.  The remote is perfect for taking pictures of birds in my birdbath and squirrels and other critters in my yard.  I personally don't like cables, I don't like dealing with them.  This is just right for my purposes.

The remote is also better for taking pics of people.  It is much better than a timer in my opinion since I can move people in and out easier and more efficiently, taking pictures more quickly.  This gives me so much more control than using a timer.

This is a great camera.  Plenty of resolution. Excellent shot speed.  Sturdy frame.  The kit lense doesn't do the camera justice.  Buy the body separate and add a better lense.

On the bad side, I had a small glitch with the camera's firmware soon after purchase and had to return it for a fix.  It was two months before the camera was returned.  Sorry, Canon...  you lose a star for that

I have gone from the old 640x480 about nine years ago to a 3.1m for the last few years to the Canon 20d now, what a pleasure to shot. The battery life has not been an issue even with over 250 shots, which should be sufficient for most anybody. There is a small learning curve but you would expect this with any new camera.
The lens choice was a great idea which came from an earlier review of the excellent walk around ability of this lens from the general shots to the closeups of those favorite flowers.
For those individuals who are on the fence about this product I tout it to all I have spoken to. It turned a good photo experience on our west coast road trip into a real serious photo shoot, it also uses the commonly accessable compact flash.
The built in flash works well have not had to explore the options at this time. The delivery of this item when promised was a nice bow on the package

I read many reviews at fredmiranda.com before I purchased this lens and I was not dissapointed one bit. I was lucky enough to receive a very sharp copy of this lens on the first try. The macro shots were very sharp and contrasty. The center part is already reaching near maximum sharpness at F2.8  Anything beyond F4 is tack sharp. Be carefull with this lens though. The DOF at F2.8 is extremely narrow. Don't mistaken the out of focus shots for being unsharp. Focus properly and crank up the aperture and you'll get some very satisfying macro shots. The only thing I wish this lens had was image stabilizer. Canon, how about a 100mm macro with IS?

Don't listen to the reviews that claim that this lens is not a good choice for cropped sensor cameras (IE the 20D, 30D, Rebels etc) the Canon L lens are the best and this particular lens is no exception. I have had the lens for less than 24 hours now and am in love with the sharpness and color already. 

Great lens, great color, so well built, super sharp, just watch out if this is your first L lens, you'll be hooked.

This is a lens you will have for many years, great investment

I shoot with a Canon 20D and have used the Canon EF 75-300mm f/4.5-5.6 III USM lens. I've always noticed the limitations of this lens when shooting amateur softball. I reviewed the lens lineup at the Canon website and decided on the Canon EF 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6L USM Lens. The 100-400mm is a great lens, but it can be a bit soft.  For that reason I decided to add the Canon EF 70-200mm 2.8/f IS USM telephoto zoom lens to my lens collection. 

This is a serious lens meant for serious photographers. Being an L lens, there is a lot of features and is manufactured with better materials with a high level of dust and moisture resistance. The construction is sturdy and consists of 23 elements in 18 groups.  The four Super UD-glass elements largely eliminate the secondary spectrum reducing residual chromatic aberration. An improved 8-blade circular aperture offers a more pleasing out-of-focus image.  The Canon EF 70-200mm lens weighs in at about 3.24 lbs/1,470 g, and accepts 77mm filters with a minimal focusing distance of 4.3 ft/1.3 m.  This lens is compatible with the extenders 1.4x II and 2x II.  Be sure to get a good quality UV haze filter to protect the front lens element.

Being white, this lens looks a bit strange, but helps keep it stay cool when shooting in the sun. Some people are concerned that being white, it attracts attention to criminals. From my experience, my 20D attracts attention regardless of what lens I put on it. In addition, I most likely have a camera bag and tripod/monopod with me to further attract attention.  I personally doubt a thief looking for something to steal is taking the time to evaluate the cost of the item and are more concerned with the ease of taking something they can unload. I try to make things difficult for would be thieves and have insurance as a back up. 

The dual IS system has two modes. Mode 1 is for stationary subjects while mode two is for moving subjects. It is recommended that the IS function is not used on a tripod; however I have used it on my monopod with success. The IS helps to eliminate camera shake and helps stabilize the lens when shooting from a moving vehicle. While there are limitations to what the IS can do, it can give you a few extra stops. Just keep in mind, the IS attempts to eliminate camera movement, not the movement of the subject being photographed. 

This lens permits for auto or manual focus depending on how the switch is set. There is also a switch to shift from a 1.4m/4.6ft to infinity or 2.5m/8.2ft to infinity. 

Included with this lens are the Tripod mount, lens hood, and storage case. The tripod mount is the best option to use when mounting to a tripod. This helps to balance the load. Mounting the camera instead creates an unbalanced set up that may topple over. The case is a zippered soft case (LZ1324) that can also be purchased separately. The lens hood (ET-86) is used to reduce lens flare and can protect the front element in certain situations.  Often times, Amazon recommends purchasing the lens case and hood, however they are normally included with the lens.

The Canon EF 70-200mm is such an awesome lens, it almost fails to compare to the Canon EF 75-300mm.  The Canon 100-400mm lens is a well used option for me, but the clarity and sharpness of the 70-200mm IS lens is more refined. The auto-focus is quiet and quick. This lens can be used for portraits, landscape, sports or as a general walk about lens.  The f/2.8L combined with the IS makes this a good option for certain low light situations.  The features add creative versatility. The Canon EF 70-200mm IS lens comes at a price, but it is worth every bit of it. 

PROS: 
Incredible clarity and sharpness 
Quiet and quick auto-focus 
Features add creative versatility 
Dual IS system 

CONS: 
Heavy and bulky (This should be expected with these types of lenses

Nick Xu, if you can't figure out the difference between this lens, and the cheaper consumer grade lenses, by all means, stay with the cheaper consumer grade lenses. After all, "Mr Magoo" of cartoon fame couldn't tell a Chevy from a Rolls Royce. All kidding aside, this lens is simply awesome in use. Having one of these lenses in a camera bag is very close in practice to owning three or four high end prime lenses. Yes, it's that good. 

I am using a borrowed version right now, but as soon as I pay off my new 24-105 f/4 L IS USM lens (very, very awesome), I will buy my own  70-200 f/2.8 IS USM. It's as good as it gets in this lens range, but if you feel comfortable with a pinhole camera, carry on, as it's all about the end user.

For everyone else, this lens is the Holy Grail of mid range telephoto lenses. It is simply the best available in it's range, and responds well to Canon tele adapters. If you can figure out a way to afford this lens, buy it, as it is all that. If you are a Nikon lover buy this lens anyway, and buy a fairly cheap 20D body to make it work. It's OK to tell your friends that you used a Nikon to take the pics, but you will end up knowing that Canon is the premeir lens crafter of the 21'st century.

(Sorry, Nikon fans, but this lens stands all by it's self in the grand scheme of things. It's simply awesome.)

I bought this lens on a whim to see what it would be like to shoot with a prime lens. At $80 it certainly was worth the risk unlike the many other Canon lenses which cost thousands of dollars. The quality of the pictures from this lens is the only thing making me move away from zoom lenses

For the money, you absolutely can't beat this lens.  It's very fast and sharp.  Not fast to focus, but what do you expect at $70?  I have four lenses , some costing 4x's as much as this one...yet I use this one the most.  Anyone looking to step up from the kit lens, or anyone looking to buy a camera body w/out the kits lens should look to buy this lens

This is a great lens for star fields. It is about the least expensive lens canon makes and also one of the fastest. The focus was sharp to the corners without coma. See my photo of a portion the Milky Way. This was obtained with a 30sec exposure with a Rebel XT on an inexpensive clock drive sitting on a picnic table

I have had my Canon Eos 30D for about a week and after 500 shutter actuations I am completely addicted to photography.  I bought the 17-85mm Canon lens and it takes phenomenal pics especially using the software and post-processing in RAW.  I also have a 70-300mm lens for sports/outdoors/nature and bursts of 5fps are a beautiful sound.  I bought the Camera through Dell and with rebates currently this is the best deal out there!  Strongly recommend.  Pay the extra $$$ and get this over the Rebel XTI.  You won't be disappointed

I upgraded from the Canon Digital Rebel (grey body) to this because I was ready to take my photography to a new level. One thing I like most about this camera is it's flash compenstation. I purchased the 430ex flash with it because I was tired of having to use the built in flash and always getting those hard shadows on the wall

Hoods offer several benefits to the photographer. Primarily the hood shades the lens from stray light that may result in an unwanted discoloration or hazing of the image, or the appearance of lens flare. Shading your lens helps improve contrast and image quality. A hood is not required to eliminate these problems, as any item used to shade the lens will provide the same protection from stray light. The hood is convenient in that it is built to offer protection while ensuring that it will not inadvertently find its way into your image. 

Photographers often state the protective abilities of a hood as a reason to have one. This hood being a solid petal shaped offers limited protection from keeping moisture and wind blown debris off the from lens element. When in place, the hood can protect the lens from impacting solid objects. Being shallow and petal shaped, this type of protection is also limited. Even if the protection is limited, replacing a damaged hood is usually cheaper than repairing the lens and easier to replace. 

This hood is manufactured for the Canon 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS EF and normally is not included with the lens when sold new.  Amazon often suggests purchasing one with your lens, and is worth considering. 

Since the hood is wider than the lens; it can easily be stored attached in a reverse position. This doesn't add to the length of the lens, but does make it wider by about an inch. An inch may not seem like a lot, but in a tightly packed camera bag, it is huge. This lens itself isn't unusually wide so the extra inch may not be a problem. 

While the protective benefits exist, they are secondary and limited. I find the impact the hood has on my image quality to be the more convincing reason to use a hood.  Considering the impact on image quality and the low cost as compared to my other camera equipment (except for a lens case), purchasing a hood is money well spent.

PROS: 
Improves contrast and image quality 
Reduces lens flare problems 
Offers limited protection to the lens 

CONS: 
Takes up more space in your camera bag to store with the lens

This is a wonderful bag for the photographer that wants a light weight bag that can still hold a lot of lenses or bodies.  The bag slings around to the front allowing the user to easily switch out lenses without having to unload the entire bag or worry about dropping an expensive lense.  Also, the bag can hold a lot of accessories.  I had to Canon Rebel XT bodies and 3 lenses in just the camera compartment.  The flap that opens up to the user when the bag is on your chest has the memory card holder, but it hold 8 memory cards which is huge!  The top has a small pouch where you can tuck away larger objects like a water bottle or map.  The all weather bag cover is built into the bag so you do not have to worry about folding it up and storing it.  The bag cover also has velcro pulls that latches it onto the bag so that it stays on insuring a dry environment inside the bag.  Basically this is a top notch bag that can get through anything.  Yes, I have actually used the bag on a few trips and find it very user friendy and reasonable

The case opens partially on the side to allow removal of the camera only. Then after unclicking the fasteners you can unzip the rest of the case to allow for access to lenses. It makes it easy if you only want to remove the camera. You can swing the bag around while wearing it and pull the camera out without taking off the pack.

My digital Rebel XT fits with the Canon Battery grip and my macro lens attached, however it would not fit with my 200mm lens attached. 

My Canon Speedlight flash did not fit well in the lense section but fits perfectly in the separate section at the top portion of the bag. The lenses all fit nicely allowing for several lenses depending on the size of them. 

I bought a regular Lowepro camera bag, but found that it was awkward to place the camera in with lens attached. This bag is designed to have the camera with a lens. 

If you search Google images for the Lowepro Slingshot 200 you will see what I mean about the side unzipping to allow the camera removal.

This UV filter does it job to protect the lens well. The build is solid (metal construction). The glass is also descent quality. 

About the performance, it absorbs some UV light. The UV light absorbtion is hardly noticeable, probably the sky 1-A and the haze filter version will absorb more UV light than this lens which is fine for me. 

Now, about the one problem which is the internal reflection. I've heard many people say that it mostly happens during night or low light shooting. I found out that it is not caused directly by the low light/night situation. The internal reflection will appear when there is a strong/bright source of light in comparison to the overall exposure (the surrounding environment). To put it in example (which hopefully is easier to understand), when you take a picture of a lamp during nightime and the light is much brighter than the surrounding area then you will see the internal reflection. as you move the position of the light to be closer to the sides/corner of the picture (and not in the center of the picture), the internal reflection reduces and finally dissapear (if you move the light far enough from the center). And if the light isn't too bright/contrast compare to the surrounding environment then there will be no internal reflection. but of course most of the time, a lamp at nightime is often very bright. But the point that I'm trying to make is that the internal reflection doesn't happen all the time during low light or night time. 

Additionally, the internal reflection isn't only happening at night. it can also happen in the afternoon if you are taking a picture of a sun for example. basically same rule as above, on how bright is the light source compared to the surrounding area, and as you move the sun from the center of the photo and near the side the internal reflection will move to the side/dissapear (also depending the angle). But the best way is just to remove the filter during these situations. 

Hope this explanation helps you to reduce the occurence of internal reflection by identifying correctly when the internal reflection will occur and then remove the filter during those situation (which is not hard to do). 

I'm actually not a fan of lens filter (any filter) as I think it will only degrade picture quality as we added another layer between the sensor and object, but I decided to use them anyway for all my lens. And I would recommend everyone to get one of this filter if you don't have any filter for your lens yet.

My all-around favorite lens in the Canon EOS system is the 50/1.4.  I find that most of the time, most of the pictures I want to take can be achieved using hte 50mm focal length, and the fast aperture allows me to take photos in low light.

I bought the 24-70/2.8 in hopes of getting high quality images from a zoom lens, as a lot of my pictures weren't in particularly dark places, and the flexibility to get a little wider or closer sounded appealing.

I was not disappointed.

The image quality produced by the 24-70/2.8 is outstanding.  Great color, great sharpness.  It might not make images quite as striking as Canon's 135/2 lens, but they are very good indeed.

Does this lens replace the 50/1.4?  No way.  The 50 is a lot smaller, weighs a lot less, and is still much better for low light shooting.  But for photographing events where you don't want to lug around several prime lenses or go to extreme lenghts to frame the shot better, the 24-70 can be a great tool

Just returned from a trip to Hawaii and had the opportunity to put this lens to the test.  I was very pleased with the results.  This is a powerful lens, yet it is relatively light weight and not burdensome to use.  I was able to get some really amazing wild life shots of birds, zooming in from a distance with a hand held camera (Canon EOS 20D) and virtually every shot was a keeper.  The IS feature allows you to quickly zoom and compose your shot and fire it off and the image quality is excellent with sharp focus.  Usually a lens this size with this much power requires a firm grip and almost always a tripod - not so with this one.   I shot in both portrait and landscape mode and I didn't see any problems with focus, clarity or sharpness.  All the images were clean and razor sharp.  If you are looking for a long lens with the ability to bring in a distant shot without having to use tripods and other equipment, I highly recommend this lens for your arsenal.

Make sure to check the compatibility charts to verify that your lenses will work with this before buying it since only a handful of L series lenses are compatible.  If you do already have one or more of these lenses though this is a nice addition.  The AF only works with lenses f/4 and faster on most camera bodies.  You do also give up a little image quality by putting this between your lens and camera body, but the extra reach is really nice

I purchased this at a photographic store because a professional said you shouldn't go higher than 1.4x.  Just keep in mind--1.4x is only "40% better".  It worked really well, but didn't increase the zoomage enough.  I decided to go with a 2x (that's twice the zoomage) teleconverter by kenko instead.  I gave this one to my brother-in-law for Christmas.

You have to think about what you want--I want to get in really close to the birds.  I have a 70-300mm zoom lens and 1.4x takes it to 98-420mm.  It is an improvement, but not nearly enough!  If you want to get twice as close, this isn't going to do it for you.  If you want to get half-again-as close, this almost gets you there.  

As far as quality, the quality is definitely there. Five stars for quality, 3 for insufficient zoomage

I was able to use the Canon EF 1.4X II Extender for some nature photography recently in Wyoming.  I shot elk in low light conditions so I was shooting pretty much wide open.  The extender did not compromise the inherent sharpness of the lens at all.  You could see the hairs on the animals heads.  It's fantastic

This is a good tool, does the job well, and serves the purpose, but is a little overpriced and Canon keeps changing connectors, forcing us to buy new accessories which is a wrong practice against the consumer.  

I give a 4 Star because of Canon, not because of the product.
If you are willing to pay for it, it's a good product.

I already have 2 of the smaller versions for other lenses but wanted to be sure my EFS 17-85-mm would be snug as a bug in its own pouch instead of a cheap felt sling thing. Well, Canon came through again with another of its soft felt line the LP1116. This pouch is thick and has the same firm bottom made of naugahide that protects the inside lens. The cord is strong and silky and doesn't open accidently the way a silky cord would. Obviously we can't throw the pouch around and we have to be careful but it really does the trick and feels good in your hand. The moment I buy another lens, I shall have to buy its matching pouch

I'd be stating the obvious and preaching to the choir if I said that care of lenses for SLR cameras required a decent lens cap.  This one snaps into 58mm threads on the end of many lenses (Canon and otherwise), so just be sure to confirm that that it's the proper size for your lens

Ive gotten used to the disposable kodaks i got from the checkout isle at walmart. The problem with those, though, is that they run out of pictures pretty quick. The last straw was when we ran out of film at the family reunion just as cousin billy was about to show us how to catch a lizard with a rubber band and a twinky. At that point I knew I needed an upgrade.

I ordered the Canon EOS-1Ds Mark II the next day, for [...] The feature that first caught my attention was the powerful zoom. Now when I take a family picture, I like to step back about a mile or two, then zoom in and snap that high-resolution masterpeice. My wife always complains that i zoom too close into the big pores on her nose, to which i respond by suggesting she use clean and clear pore cleansing strips (watch for her upcoming review of those soon). 

Another useful feature of this camera is the continuous shooting mode. This is where the camera automatically takes pictures in rapid succession, about 5 per second. The other day I set the camera on the dresser, turned on the macarena, and got wild. I then took the individual pictures and strung them together into an animated flipbook. Now watching myself do the macarena is a mere flip of the book away. Man i can dance.

To summarize, you will have a lot of fun with this cam like i did. Definitely worth the [...] ! But remember, there is a [...] that comes with it; so make sure you fill in the item number clearly on the [...] card, and make sure you stay within the space alloted on the form otherwise the [...] wont go through

This camera has the potential for pictures with amazing clarity and colors but not straight out of the camera. 

I too was disappointed after converting the RAW files with C1 Pro and ACR. Was it possible that my D-Rebel would be better than this monster that gives me neck pains and has made my right arm to start looking like Swartzenegger's arm? Even with L glass the results were dissapointing. 

The problem is not with the camera but with the workflow. After using it for 2 months I am getting used to a workflow that will give me the results I am looking for. I had to realize that this camera does not perform any processing enhancements in camera because the pros need to do it themselves. Once I got over the fact that I would have to sharpen and saturate colors a lot more than before I was content and have never touched the D-Rebel ever since.

PS Beware of the severe neck pains when attaching any L zoom lens. Buy the hand strap or a better neck strap.

I gave this monopod to my boyfriend, as a gift, and it's been perfect for his use.  He videotapes his kids's baseball and softball games, and was tired of holding the camcorder for so long.  He didn't want to deal with a bulky tripod when he was getting up and down, so a monopod seemed like a great idea.  He has LOVED it!!  He says it keeps the camera very steady and it's very easy to change the height so he can use it sitting or standing.  He's no professional, but he uses his camcorder a lot, and he'll be happily using the monopod for a long time

If you've found these reviews, you already know this lens is one of the best Canon products out there. I did not bite on the IS version, and I have not found myself ever wishing I did; this lens is everything it's hyped up to be and performs well in low-light/indoor situations.

I don't think it's weight is that big a deal. I really don't have any problem carrying this lens around for a day -- in my hands or in a bag -- even with a 1.4 extender attached. It can feel a bit heavy but I don't mind, and neither will you when you see the results later on.

I've used this a lot for shooting professional baseball and it's landed me front page ink several times. In my mind, I could get the 1.4 extender with this lens and give myself a 70-280 range, which is pretty adequate for most sports and nature photography, considering the 300 f/2.8 and it's friends are much, much more expensive. The lens works basically just as fast and sharp, in my opinion, with the 1.4 at f/4, although some may debate this. Flip on any baseball or football game and you will see this lens around the neck of most every pro.

If you can swing the price, enjoy it! My advice is to continue reading up on this or similar products, although I found most everyone agreed, this is one of the finest lens around. It's one that makes people stop and stare and wonder who you are

my cousin's wife is a professional studio photographer who occasionally lends out her lenses to me for clothing / lifestyle photoshoots (I've been pretty active in this area for some time, just now starting to go full digital), and I've used the f/2.8L about four or five times and this is one of the best lenses I've used. period. shooting wide open allows you to retain high shutter speeds for night shots, as well as get very interesting and vibrant long shutter shots (of crowds, the freeway at night, etc). when shooting action shots, the tripod mount can get in the way of zooming and focusing, but it can be removed easily enough.

I personally just purchased the f/4.0L, which, coupled with a relatively wide max aperture and shooting at either 1600 or 3200 on my 20D, should do nicely, but I still rate the 2.8 high up on my list

This is the first IS lens that I've owned. I had trouble justifying the extra expense but am now quite pleased that I took the step up. 

Keep in mind that tis is an EF not EF-S lens. This makes its effective focal length about 45-215mm on my Digital Rebel.

I love the zoom range (great for shooting action shots of kids without getting in their faces) and the ability to easily control the depth of field on my nature shots.

Just uploaded some of my recent shots with this lens under "Share your own customer images".

I bought the Rebel XT w/ the 18-55 lens exactly 18 hours before the XTI was introduced, but that's another story. As this is my first DSLR, I was blown away by the results. But after the initial euphoria, there is always room for improvement. My first choice was the 28-200, favoring the longer zoom over the IS, but I found this one used at Penn Camera and got a deal on it and a 380EX flash, so the decision was made for me. 
I like the zoom range, it's great for framng portraits. If I need wider angle, I still have the kit lens. 
I won't make the usual complaints about the herky-jerky zoom ring or the rackety extension tubes, as I was prepared for this by these reviews before I ever saw the lens.
I'm no expert on sharpness, and still trying to get myself dialed in, but my shots so far look pretty sharp to me. I have no "L" lenses to compare to, nor would I make the comparison if I did. 
In my somewhat uninformed opinion, this is a great step up from the kit lens. This is a lens a working guy can afford and most likely get great results with. Being a working guy, I'm extremely happy with it so far, and glad I made the purchase.

Best (compromise for an) Exploration Camera

5 frames per second is barely enough to capture dolphins - hence the 8 + fps of the EOS 1 was desired
</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
I had been waiting 3 years for any manufacturer to market a camera similar in specification to the Canon EOS1. As exploration Health, Safety &amp; Environment advisor, work takes me to middle of the desert or the oceans. The wait was for 35mm film quality, with speed of picture taking (5 frames per second is barely enough to capture dolphins - hence the 8 + fps of the EOS 1 was desired). There was a parallel wait for an Image Stabilised 28-300 zoom lens.

Let's cut the story short. If I want a camera to bring on holiday, it would not be this one - the battery and charger are too heavy and bulky; instead I would choose the EOS20D without hesitation.

But having hundreds of failed 35mm film frames I decided not to wait any longer but to buy the EOS1D Mark II because the 1Ds Mark II is not fast enough at 4 frames a second.

With 35mm cameras, after a few seconds on the shooting, I would have to run back inside to the cabin (of a ship) to change film. If there is large enough memory card in the EOS1DII, there is no need. This camera is built with seals against the environment (and so does the 28-300mm lens). Instead of being scared of running out of film, now it is easy to keep the shutter button pressed while panning (and hoping) the dolphins do their jumps into the air.

With the 28-300mm lens attached, there is no need to change lenses either. Dolphins riding the bow wave of the ship could be captured at 28mm while those further away could be caught with 300mm setting.

It is a disappointment that the battery is not LiOn but the older NiMH. But as with any photo gear requiring a battery it is wise to have a spare, whatever the substance. I just wish Canon package a small travel size charger instead of the standard one which is very bulky. It has connections for two batteries (yet it could only charge one following the other) but most people would be happy using one battery while the other one is being charged. You just try to convince some airport officials to let you on the plane with the above kit, binoculars, laptop, mobile phone, GPS.......ext. hard disk....as hand luggage.

For work, I am committed and therefore bear the weight and troubles of hauling the hardware. But for holidays, I would choose the EOS20D with built-in flash because who would want to lug around 3 kilos all day plus flash gun and possibly a tripod?

The camera gets 4.5 stars but the battery and charger lets it down. Why just 4.5 stars ? One of the beauties I had thought with digital SLR was not having to do anything in processing, just transfer the images to the computer. Wrong. The .jpg straight out of the camera is not sharp enough. Post processing is required. Why ? Why is that necessary when the Canon S60 (which I use for different assignments (with underwater housing)) doesn't need to ? That defeats the point of having a .jpg file at 5.5 Meg when the 1.5 Meg of the S60 looks sharper straight out of the camera ? Still, there is RAW if the standard output is not suficient.

Incidentally, the EOS1DsII also produces 5.5 Meg .jpg and those also require post processing. For those of us who are not interested in working longer than necessary (me) 16.7 Million Pixels would seem a bit wasted.

I am still waiting for the camera which produces sharp .jpg files in-camera without having to post process, and can shoot at 8+ fps with a sensor size equivalent to 35mm film. Meantime I shall have to learn to shoot with RAW files and post process.

Also incidentally, the sensor size of the EOS20D is smaller, which means although itself is lighter than the EOS1D series camera, having to carry around an extrawide lens is not my idea of fun on holiday. The magnification ratio for the EOS1DII is 1.3 whereas the EOS20D is 1.6. This means I could still travel reasonably light (compromise) with the 1DII and 28-135mm IS lens attached. Sure it is possible to use stitching but that is more time spent at the computer and time is precious.

Any regrets ? None what-so-ever. It is state of the technology at the moment. Another benefit of using digital is that, it doesn't matter if you had been shooting ISO 100 all day. come the night if you want to shoot the rig with a moon as backdrop, just change to ISO 1600 without having to bother about "pushing2 the film in developing. It's a beauty when an IS L lens is attached. You'd need IS when there is machinery vibrations and the ship is moving with the swell ! Good job Canon. Now you need to shoe horn in a more capable CPU (to process the images in-camera), fit the 1DsII sensor into this one or this motordrive into the 1DsII and you may persuade me to part with more cash.

I recently purchased this for use with my 550EX. If you use alot of flash for event photography, you will want this in your kit. It is expensive, but I think it is worth every penny. It will keep you from changing AAs in your strobe and it quickens the recycle times to nearly instant. You can shoot bursts and still get the proper flash exposure. You can attach a strap to sling it over your shoulder or slip it on your belt. Mounting on my 20D was just not comfortable. It gets in the way of the hand-grip

This is a great lens for any user, professional or amateur.  This lens offers incredibly wide focal lengths all while giving very impressive/clean results.  A slight distortion is noticeable when shooting at 10mm (16mm cropped) but this is easily correctable with software.  In addition, the very fast and absolutely silent USM is a huge plus.  I highly recommend this lens to anyone wanting great landscapes or great in door/architecture shots (especially realtors)

Many great things have already been said about this lens, and I will support them!

My copy delivers outstanding sharpness (nearly on par with my 24-70L) even *wide open* (rare for a wide angle of all but the finest German manufacturers), great color, very little distortion (many objective tests have revealed that it's probably the "best of breed" ultra wide angle), and impressive contrast. Surprisingly, the build quality is not bad: tight fitting mount, damped rings, and no jiggles or rattles.

If I were forced to offer a (slight) negative, it would be the bokeh of the lens is somewhat "marbly"...However, when shooting a subject with an OOF area differential high enough to make bokeh a component of the frame, then the subject is likely going to demand far more attention than the bokeh! ;)

A fine lens, Canon: definitely worth the premium over the Sigma and Tokina rivals (both of which I sampled before purchasing this optic)

I had the Tokina 12-24 f4 and it was a great sharp lens. This Canon focuses faster and is wider. If you're worried about full frame in the future don't be. Just buy this lens and enjoy the ultra wide images. It light, fast and sharp. "L" quality pictures. The build could be better but I don't see any problems down the road.

If you don't need the speed or can't afford the expensive 85mm f1.4 Nikkor lens or both, then this lens may be the right one for you. It took Nikon a while to produce a superb compact 85mm lens, but this time they finally got it right. Without a doubt, this is a fine portrait lens for photographing head-and-shoulder portraits (The only lens which is optically better is Nikon's legendary 105mm f2.5 Nikkor lens, and its close optical twin, the 105mm f2.8 Micro Nikkor.). Since the 105mm f2.5 Nikkor lens doesn't have an autofocus version, then this might be the perfect moderate telephoto lens for owners of Nikon autofocus SLR cameras. Regardless, this lens has a well-earned reputation for excellent contrast and resolution

This is original equipment battery charger manufactered by Canon. The performance of the charger is excellent as are most Canon products. The price paid was comparible to non-sale priced items puchased via internet sites. The item was recieved in original packaging, 3 days after placing the order, was new (not reconditioned with a new appearance). I am extremely pleased with the entire purchase process experienced, from the information given at the site to ease of ordering and fast shipping

Slightly smaller than the charger that comes with the S(40,45,50,...) series cameras and the digital rebel series cameras.  Seems to charge in about the same time.  Feels a bit more substantial, but that's not saying much as the chargers that come with those cameras seem pretty flimsy.  I can't give it 5 stars because it does nothing more than the chargers that come with the cameras (which I lost)

I bought this lens to go with my Canon Digital Rebel XT.  I absolutely love this lens.  I got it to try some insect and other macro shots and it has served this purpose very well.  With some practice this lens will produce fantastic macros with some great bokeh to boot.  
I read the other reviews and must say that I have never scared an insect away with the noise as mentioned before.  And I have taken countless insect shots with this lens.  It is a bit louder than the other lenses I have but I don't see it to be a problem.  The one problem I do encounter is when using the autofocus in a busy closeup scene it often will focus on the background instead of say a closer insect on a flower.  When this happens I just flip it to manual and focus that way.  No big deal.
Overall, great lens for an even greater price.  Definitely worth it.  (I submitted a photo of a bee that I took a couple of days ago with this lens as an example.)

I purchased this lens back in March of 2005 to shoot static "Warhammer models" with my 10D.  I found that longer lenses such as the Sigma 105mm, the Canon EF 100mm, and the Tamron SP Autofocus 90mm all were "too long" with the 10D's 1.6 focal crop and would result in requiring me to use a lot more physical space that what I had room for to get the shot.

The Canon EF 50mm f/2.5 is nearly a perfect match with the 10D for this purpose.  Its small, its compact, and its short focal length do not require that I be standing three feet away from the model I'm shooting.

As far as shooting at non-static objects, such as insects, the lens is slow to focus and loud, in both noise and vibration, which results in "startled" subjects and missed shots.

The same also applies for non-macro shots as well.  Its slow focus makes it a poor choice for action photography, and its loud enough to draw attention to you when you are attempting other shots as well

This is a great camera that takes the place of an earlier Canon Digital Elph that I lost several years ago. The 7.1 megapixels ensures great quality and the 3x zoom provides crisp clear pictures. In fact the digital zoom also works great - just make sure the camera is steady (I purchased a nice compact monopod and the results were awesome). Although the image stabilization feature on the newer models would have been great to have, you can't beat the price and overall quality of this camera and the pictures it takes. The Canon SD500 is a great little camera

Hoods offer several benefits to the photographer. Primarily the hood shades the lens from stray light that may result in an unwanted discoloration or hazing of the image, or the appearance of lens flare. Shading your lens helps improve contrast and image quality. A hood is not required to eliminate these problems, as any item used to shade the lens will provide the same protection from stray light. The hood is convenient in that it is built to offer protection while ensuring that it will not inadvertently find its way into your image. 

Photographers often state the protective abilities of a hood as a reason to have one. This hood being a solid conical two inch long offers some protection from keeping moisture and wind blown debris off the from lens element. There is nothing more irritating than reviewing your images to find dust spots or other flaws. When in place, the hood can protect the lens from impacting solid objects. Replacing a damaged hood is usually cheaper than repairing or replacing a lens. 

This hood is manufactured for the Canon 85 f/1.8 USM EF, 100 f/2.0 USM EF, 135 f/2.8 USM EF, 100-300 f/4.5-5.6 USM EF lenses and normally is not included with the lens when sold new.  Amazon often suggests purchasing one with your lens, and is worth considering.  

Since the hood is wider than the lens; it can easily be stored attached in a reverse position. This doesn't add to the length of the lens, but does make it wider by about an inch. An inch may not seem like a lot, but in a tightly packed camera bag, it is huge. Fortunately Canon provides a storage case with the lens that can be used in addition to your camera bag. 

While the protective benefits exist, they are secondary and limited. I find the impact the hood has on my image quality to be the more convincing reason to use a hood. Considering the impact on image quality and the low cost as compared to my other camera equipment (except for a lens case), purchasing a hood is money well spent.

PROS: 
Improves contrast and image quality 
Offers limited protection to the lens 

CONS: 
Takes up more space in your camera bag to store with the len

I bought this hood after reading elsewhere that it fits the 50mm f/1.8 Mark I (the version with the metal mount and distance scale) that I purchased recently.  Canon specs the discontinued ES-65 hood for this lens.  The great thing about this ET-65III is that it is longer, so it blocks more stray light without vignetting on full-frame or 1/6-frame slrs.  The interior on this mark III version is also flocked, providing a bit more light absorption.

I've used those collapsible rubber hoods before while in college, but this hood is definitely worth the investment:  well built, fits backward on the lens for storage (but too long while the lens is on the camera), and provides good protection for the front of the lens (it's quite deep).

Note that this will NOT fit the newer 50mm f/1.8 Mark II version (all plastic mount with no distance scale)

The POWER-2000 XP-333 charges batteries in pairs, with one LED per pair, not as described.  The XP-555 charges each battery independently and slightly faster (3 vs 4 hours).  The XP-333 charger is very lightweight, the XP-555 is slightly heavier.   They work on 110 or 220 V and includes plug adaptors for round European type plugs.  I have used the XP-333 in the USA and overseas.  POWER-2000 makes several other charger models as well.  

The XP-333 and 555 AAs are 2500 mAh, and there are XP-33327 and XP-55527 versions now available with 2700 mAh batteries.  AAA batteries charge faster as they hold less charge.  AAAs from Power-2000 currently come in 850 and 1000 mAh capacities.  

I believe that these capacities for AA and AAA from POWER-2000 and other NiMH makers are twice as great or maybe more than alkalines.  As I recall, some years ago Duracell copper top AAs have 1100 mAh.  I have not found recent figures on the web, but got the old figure by calling the 800 number on the Duracell packages.  Duracell Ultras appear to have a bit higher mAh figure, but I do not know that that is.  

The 1.2 V for NiMH vs 1.5 V for alkalines seems to make no practical difference as I am told, and I believe it is correct, that alkaline voltage drops rapidly under 1.5 V after initial use while I understand that the NiMH holds its 1.2 V value for some time.

I won the Kodak printer at a scrapbook convention &amp; then went on the hunt to find the refills at a reasonable price. Purchasing the 160 count made the price per print the lowest &amp; beat out anything I could find in the local stores. It is a great convenience to be able to whip out a 4x6 print instead of having to download it to a store's website, wait a few days, go there &amp; pick it up, etc. Great value

Hi have a Rebel Extreme, and needed to use the high-speed mode... but the flash couldn't even vaguely keep up.  I was taking pictures of dancers, so needed a flash system that could keep up.  The Speedlite really does this perfectly - I'm able to take a rapid-fire sequence of photos, and this flash system is there each time.  I don't know if it really helps when taking a single photo, but if you want a flash that can keep up, this one is great!  I like it so much, I'm planning on buying one or two more for my next shoot, to run in slave mode with this one.

I'm new to the digital SLR world. I had been using the built in flash on my Rebel XT. The built-in flash had done alright, but was nothing to write home about. Since I had spent most of my money on the camera, I needed a flash that was both affordable and would get the job done. This flash met both requirements. IF you are an advance user, you will want a higher end flash because the flash has limited adjuastable features. Yet, if you a newbie like me, this flash is GREAT! It has improved my picture quality dramaticly.

This lens has gotten some bad reviews, I think, partly because it is starting to show it's age.  This was the first USM IS lens, and the technology has REALLY grown since then.  If Canon were to come along with an updated 75-300 USM IS lens, man, it would blow everything away.  

That being said, yes, this lens IS a little slow to focus.  But, if you are not using it for work like one of the professional sports photographers you see on the sidelines at baseball games, you should be okay.  It also could use an extra stop (or two, or three!) because when you are handholding, you need that aperture to be as open as it can be. 

All of this aside, I really have gotten some gems of pictures out of this lens.  It lets you get as closer then you possibly could hope for.  If you have asteady hand and plently of availible light, you can get some really nice shots.  If you are in a low light situation... you will need a tripod.  The IS of lens works... pretty good, but I have had a number of ever so slightly blurry pictures that wouldn't have been had there been some more aperature room to play with. 

All in all, its a good starter telephoto lens, especially for digital SLRS since it really extends the zoom on those.  Its great for the price, and when you decide to upgrade to one of those white canon L beauties, just sell it

I cannot help but giggle when I saw comments like "great lens for the money". It is selling for $440 at here, even on so-called clearance. However, one can easily find the same lens at least $50 cheaper at some decent online camera store, such as B&amp;H, ritz camera, etc. Sad Amazon..

The lens fulfilled all of our expectations as to quality of portraits and field of view flexibility.
The stabilization aspect is a great help, although it doesn't compensate for someone pushing the shutter too fast in low light conditions.
Highly recommend this lens as the standard use lens for the Canon Rebel XT

I am 67 years old and started out in photography as a kid with a contact printer and a box camera. I have had all types of cameras over the years, mostly 35mm film Canon slr's. I too bought all sorts of these 5-7 MP point and shoot digital cameras before returning to my true love, SLR's. I have had my digital Canon Rebel XT about a month now and I can't keep my hands off of it. It lacks nothing. Although the kit lense is good, I bought a 28-135 Canon zoom lense with image stabilizion and have produced stunning photo's with it. I love the way you can use the 7 points to focus, I mainly use only the center point with focus lock and never get an out of focus picture. I guess the nicest thing for me is that I now don't have the urge to buy every point and shoot camera that is paraded out on QVC or HSN that has a "wonderful" new feature like "low light or non-shake." This Canon has every good feature in the known universe and you can't outgrow it. Its a camera that will let you be as good as you can be, it won't hold you back. The battery life is great, the built in flash is good but I bought a 430EX and that's even better. I never figure I'm wasting money buying accessories for this camera as it will be my main squeeze for many years to come. I always missed my 35mm Canon slr's and now feel that I have an old friend back again, only much much better. Believe me, you can't go wrong getting this camea, its beyond description...

When digital cameras first came out, I, like many people swore I'd always be loyal to film. Digital could never take the place of film. I'm not convinced that it has replaced film completely. There's still something I love about putting a roll of film in the camera, shooting away, sending the film to be processed, and seeing the results. I also know it's a bit expensive. I know that the argument about quality has always been paramount in the discussion, but digital cameras are improving in this regard, and most manufacturers are assuring users that while the technology will always be improving, we are at a point where a good investment can be made in a digital SLR and it will not be outdated as soon as the buyer purchases the camera. So I figured now is the time to get a digital SLR. 

I have been a loyal Nikon user for nearly ten years, and have owned the Nikon N60, N70, and N80. My first love was, and still is the N70 (I've been told by the person who sold me the camera he thought I was the only person who loved the N70).  I purchased the N80 only after my N70 cost too much to repair, but I've enjoyed the way my various Nikon cameras have handled all sorts of situations and the fact that they can be as simple to use as a point and shoot if I don't have the time to use specific controls, but it also has options for more creative and artistic purposes. My Nikon cameras have allowed me to capture family moments with ease and majestic landscapes, wildlife shots and all sorts of other things I can't resist to capture forever.

I decided to purchase the D70 since it was close to what I've already experienced with Nikon. In many ways it works in a similar way to the N70 and 80, except it's a digital rather than film version. Like the film versions of the midrange Nikon SLR's, it has a dial that allows an automatic setting,  portrait, landscape, sports, close-up, nightscape, and night portrait modes, the ability to select aperture, shutter speed or manual controls. The camera has auto and manual focus abilities. Photos can be as easy or technical as the photographer desires. The controls are easy to use, though it takes practice to be comfortable. On a personal level, the camera has passed the Halloween test, niece's birthday test, and fall foliage in New England test and favorite scenic spots test. The only real difficulty I've had with the camera is trying to capture stained glass windows in a dark setting. Auto focus has not worked at all and I'm not thrilled with the manual focus of these shots, but at this point I'm sure it's the photographer and not the camera.

I do have one suggestion for anyone who purchases this camera. The manual is very confusing. It uses all sorts of symbols and can be more of a distraction than anything else. I've had luck with the "Magic Lantern Guides" with my other cameras, but have not as of yet used it for this camera. I did purchase the NIKON D70 FIELD GUIDE (David Busch, Wiley Publishing) which has been helpful. It can be a quick reference for anyone already familiar with Nikon and photography in general but it also provides and introduction for the novice to photography.

I have owned this camera for about two months now and have taken about 100 photographs (keepers) to date.  Because I have been involved in photography for almost 35 years, I have developed certain prejudices. In particular, I have never been comfortable with auto exposure and even less comfortable with auto focus. In fact, the last auto focus camera I owned was a Nikon N8008s that I ultimately sold at auction because I could not adapt to using the various auto settings.

However, I like this camera. Why? The D70s is a very easy camera to use and I have only had to refer to the manual to check on a couple of settings and look up some features. Honestly, set up takes only a few minutes and handling is not terribly different from a film camera. I should point out that this camera is really designed for auto focus lenses and if you choose to use your manual focus lot, you will disable many of the camera's features.
 
Because I am both stubborn and cheap (but mostly only when it comes to spending money on myself) I am using my manual focus lenses on this camera. It is true that I do not get any internal exposure meter readings and must rely on a handheld Gossen or the sunny 16 rule (quite effective, really) for exposure determination. The LCD preview screen thus is critical for determining or adjusting exposure. I should also point out that the depth of field preview feature is also lost when using manual focus lenses. I was stunned when I could not stop my lens down and burrowed through the manual to find out what I was doing wrong--which was nothing except that I was using the wrong type of lens. While I really miss this feature, I am not sure how big a loss it really is because of the viewfinder. Others have made mention of the low magnification and tunnel like views through the finder and I can attest to this fact. I compared finder views to my trusty old FM and was just stunned by how poorly the D70 compared.  

Ultimately the best camera is the camera you use and the D70 has become my camera of choice. Even though I am using this camera like a vintage M series Leica--i.e., handheld meter and presetting exposure in anticipation of a photograph--I find that I can live with this level of usability. At some point I will probably buy an auto focus lens (maybe the 35 f2) and make full use of the feature set.  But for now I content on using the camera the old fashioned way

Other than the months of waiting for Nikon to deliver them to Amazon for shipping, the battery itself in a good deal.  They work well, charge up easy and hold their charge nicely.  Priced well, they cost less than the same type battery than Canon or Sony.  I bought them for a D80 and the older En-EL3a would not fit.  Of course I had 10 of the older batteries for my D70s and was rather surprised when they didn't fit the D80.  Basically the same size and shape, but keyed differently.  I was also surprised to find the 3e WOULD fit in the D70s, meaning they are backward compatable.

This battery is backwards compatible with the D50, D70/70s, and is used in the D80 and D200.  So if you have any Nikon DSLR and want a second battery, you want to get this one so that when you upgrade your camera you can use the battery.

This battery has built-in circuitry that tells you the actual charge status of the battery, and it is accurate.  This is a big deal; *if you are using the D200 or D80* it lets you know when your really do need to switch batteries or charge up.  This is the first battery I've seen that is accurate in this regard.  Kudos to Nikon. (This feature does not work in the D50/70/70s but the battery otherwise works fine)

I switched from the Digital Rebel XT. Since I already had L-glass lenses, I didn't run into problems with the 5D "exposing" cheaper lenses. The 17-40mm really shines on the full sensor! The burst rate is simply astonishing. Missing flash doesn't bother me, heck it's a $3000 camera, I don't expect a built-in flash. I have the Speedlite 580EX, which of course is wonderful in itself. I also have the battery grip which I recommend, as well as the RS-80N3 cable release. Image quality is superb overall - the 5D REALLY shines in high ISO numbers - more so than even the 1D from what I've read. Even at 1600 there's hardly any noise. It allows you to take great, crisp photos in low light where other cameras would require a flash. 

The camera also is quite light while being very sturdy at the same time. The 3 fps might bother some, but I prefer the incredible burst numbers.

There are no professionals or would-be professional  photographers in our house.  Instead we are ametuers who love to get fun shots of our friends and family.  We're not particularly interested in birds, flowers, bugs, race cars, etc.  We want to catch our kids doing what they love best; football, basketball, swimming, band, golf...

My only advantage is that I am very experienced with Adobe Photoshop, which lets me creatively salvage some less-than-perfect shots.

This year our son is a high-school senior.  Instead of buying an expensive portrait package, we voted to spend the money on a Canon Digital Rebel XT kit (with lens).  We choose one extra zoom lense (the 75-300mm f4-5.6 III USM Telephoto) for up-close action sports shots.  We didn't chose the IS lens because it was out of our price range.

We are having great fun with this camera and lens.  We have already taken a variety of football game pictures using the 'basic' sports setting on the camera (burst mode at full zoom).  They are great - crisp and clear.  These have been taken in full sun.  We realize that we'll have to get a little more creative when we are taking pictures in lower light situations.  But I think we can do it.

I would recommend this lens for anyone who just wants to capture some fun shots.  They might not be professional quality, but they are just what we wanted

This monopod does a great job for my camera. You have the quick, easy-off, it attatches to your camera by a screw, and you can press the button on the side of the monopod and just slide your camera right off of it quickly. I wanted a nice, inexpensive monopod for my new zoom lense. I have a Canon 35mm, and I recently purchased a 75-300 zoom lense for it, and I needed a monopod to stabilize the shoot. If I knew then what I know now, I would buy it again. Nice product

I bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it, or have already bought it--it's size.  It is amazingly small, it's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera.  I take it with me everywhere,literally, it is so small that I am able to keep it in my pocket, and I don't have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable. There is also a small covering for the lens, so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched.
The picture quality surprised me, when I first saw this camera I saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good--but I was wrong!  The picture quality of this camera is outstanding (taking its' size and price into consideration).

However, I do have a few things to complain about...

First off, the battery.  This camera uses a lithium battery, I find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient; because what if you are on vacation, where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station--there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there.  Not only is it inconvenient, but also the battery life span is short.  The longest I've had it work was about 1 hour and 45 minutes.  This isn't uncommon in cameras, though, just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries, you should be fine.

Another problem I had with this camera was the zoom function.  Such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in...wrong!  Very wrong.  The zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet.  Even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little, resulting in a noisy start-up.

The flash is very weak.  Really dissapointing. If you are inside, you can't be any farther away then 10 feet in a lit room.

The last problem I found with this camera was the macro function.  The auto-focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject.  To make matters work, there is no manual override to overcome this problem.  The focus is great, though, if you are not taking a macro shot.

These are all the flaws I found in the camera, it's not my first choice in cameras, I have come across many other beginner cameras that I prefer over this camera, but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size.  If you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times, then this is a great camera choice.

Pros:
- Reduces flare and ghosting when shooting in bright light.
- Helps protect your lens from dirt and scratches.
- Somewhat protects the lens in case of a fall.  Better to break the hood than the front element.
- Makes you look more like you know what you are doing and helps keep others from carelessly walking in front of you.

Cons:
- Will increase lens movement in windy situations, kind of like a sail on a boat.
- Takes up more room in your bag, even when reversed they still add to the diameter of the lens.
- People take more notice of you, will help to blow your cover if you are trying to keep a low profile

I received my 28-200 yesterday from Amazon.  Having read the customer reviews, I immediately put my Rebel XT on a tripod and ran two series of comparison shots with the 28-200 and my Canon 28-135 IS.  Three shots each at f-stops 5.6, 11, and 20, one set indoors at ISO 1600 and the other outdoors at ISO 200.  Focal length 135 using the same scenes with each camera, highest jpeg setting. After shooting both series, I compared them fresh out of the camera, side by side.  Results:  the 28-200 was at least as sharp as the 28-135 in both foreground and background in most instances.  It was visibly sharper at ISO 200 with f-stops 5.6 and 20, (the 28-135 took the honors at f-stop 10), and at 20, it was visibly sharper in both the foreground and the background.  The 28-135 was one-stop faster shutterwise.  Both lenses produced pictures which would sharpen nicely in Photoshop.  There are the vagaries of autofocus and different shooting conditions to consider; different test scenes conceivably produce different results.  My conservative conclusion:  the 28-200 is as good as it gets for a super-zoom on your Canon (unless you are going to drop $2200 on the L Series 28-300 IS and carry it), and the 28-135 IS has no clear sharpness advantage.  Between these lenses, its a tradeoff---an extra 65 mm of focal length (105 mm after a 1.6 conversion) versus image stabilization and low-light shooting capability. Both lenses focus quickly and silently, and both lenses produce usable shots.

I've bought several lenses from Adorama, two of which include a new 300/2.8 IS and the other, this 500/4 IS. All of their deliveries were prompt and well packed. I have zero complaints with them. I dealt the John (Green, I think is his last name) via email. I highly recommend them.

As for this lens, it is incredible. Wide open it creates a wickedly sharp subject against a wonderfully soft background (good bokeh). AF is very fast. This lens is extremely good and will still AF when used with the 1.4x converter. (AF works up to f5.6.

I love the new digital Canon. The only problem is it's not nearly as tough as it's film twin.  I had the camera less than a month when the pop-up flash quit working.  The Canon people have been great, and very helpful, but I'd rather not have had to send a brand new camera back to the factory.  The photos, however, are wonderful.  Film quality for the most part - printable and enlargable.  (It would probably be better to use the camera with a tripod when using the 300mm telephoto but I hike with it, so just remember to steady it before taking wildlife photos.

When I bought this camera the sales people tried to get me to buy another battery.  They said the one that came with it would only be good for about 20 minutes.  Now I have bought alot of items in my lifetime, a 20 min battery on a camera just doesnt seem like a very good "business" choice.  So I said no.  So I got the camera, charged the battery until the light went green (which sucked because I wanted to play with it right when i got it) and started taking pictures (oh I also got a 2G CF) worked great....so I planned to go up a mountain and take soem scenery shots.  Keeping in mind what the sales person had told me I pocketed the charger just incase.  Well, 6000', 300 pictures, and 5 hours later the camera is still running strong, still have 200 shots left for the trip home, battery life indicator hasnt budged off of the full button.  So all in all, I think the battery life is great, now i can see if your taking say thousands of pictures all in a row you may need another but for just going on a trip and shooting a few pictures at every stop point, the original will work fine.  as for the quality of photos.....i love them

It's a pretty convinient bag.I put a Canon rebel XT with a Tamron 28-75 lens,a Canon 70-300 lens and a external flash inside and I still have the small pocket for wallet,keys etc.
The only drawback of this bag is,you can not put in big lenses.The Canon 70-300 is the limit.But if you only have a limited gear collection,you need to give it a try

It was everything it advertised as being.  I can carry my digital camera and lenses as well as two point and shoot digital cameras.  Being a slingshot backpack, my back doesn't moan and groan as it did with other camera bags.  I like the feature of swinging the bag to the front and to get my cameras with out removing the backpack

I have had this bag for a year and recommend it.  I use it all the time.  It's a great walkaround bag.  The first time you're in a place where you want to get to your camera quickly or don't want to put your bag down you'll appreciate the sling design.  Just be aware for a long mountain hike you may feel the weight on your shoulder after some time.

My only error was getting the 100 - I should have gone with the 200, and plan to do so.  I like to keep my lens hood in place which requires a little more room.  I'd also found that I need a little more room for non-camera things.

A word on the all-weather cover - a great feature.  A few weeks ago I was in Bermuda and walked to a beach about 25 minutes away.  Just as I arrived a soaking rain began that didn't let up for the entire walk back.  If I hadn't been able to pull on the cover my equipment would have been soaked.  Now I wouldn't buy a bag without one

I just got back from vacation. I have a bad back, and it was sore. I was very happy to discover that the way this bag hangs, I could carry my Nikon D-70 and one or two extra lens very comfortably. 

Gear is super easy to access and the bag provides a nice platform for changing lenses.

I have other bags which heft lots of gear, and they're great for travel days and the occasional big shoot, but if you're looking to hike (and have a separate way to carry a tripod), then this is a wonderful bag

<review_text>
Got the Lowero SlingShot 100 about 2 months ago, and it is really coming in handy.  In the main area, it holds my pentax digital slr with one lens mounted, 1 rather small lens and 1 decently big zoom lens (80-320mm), plus a Sigma EF-500 Super flash.  It's packed in there, and the flash just barely fits, but i don't need much more room.  The top compartment holds extra batteries, recharger, etc.  Really easy to access the main pocket when it is on my back...just by pulling the case to my front (no need to take it off my back).  Well made.  Zippers are strong so I don't have to worry about one loosening and my equipment falling out.  Perfect for the amateur to semi-pro photographer.

This is an excellent device. Quick respond with my D80.
I use it to take the family pictures that include me.
I just point and press this remote to activate the D80's timer and It works beautifully

I use it with my Nikon D70, and am very satisfied with it.
I most often use it for long exposures, for taking picture that include myself, and for taking pictures of my 6-month old daughter, who stops acting naturally when she notices I hold the camera, so I place it on the tripod, and take pictures of her.

If you are shooting with a compact chip camera like the 20D or rebel xt, you will be happier with the 8mm fisheye.  This 15mm fisheye will just be a really distorted wide angle lens due to the 1.6 factor.  If you love the fish eye style and have that camera, you'll need something WIDER to compensate for your smaller chip.

I was disapointed with this lens for that reason.  The Sigma 8mm is great.  A note to the reviewer below.  Sigma makes some good lenses and bad ones.  This is a good one and you probably got a bad copy.  It happens often enough with sigma gear.  With this lens, its good to go and try one at your local camera shop and make sure it has the style you want.  Bring YOUR camera with a chip in it and take a few shots and go home to check them out.  Decide if you like the style and if that piece of glass is a good copy.

I got a good copy and was still disapointed because of my lack of knowledge.  Sounds like you got a bad one

I have not actually taken this underwater yet, but it appears to be well made and of similar quality to other cases. It keeps the
over-all size of the camera/case down to a size that could fit into a BC pocket. On the downside, it does have only limited functionality of the camera through the available buttons. You can zoom and telephoto, change from camera,playback and to movie mode and shoot the picture. You cannot do any of the setup functions while it is in the case. Regarding a stobe, Sony makes one that looks a little cheezy. There is a "universal" strobe by Sea Life (SL 960D) that fits, but the fiber-optic trigger is just taped onto the flash of the camera. I'm waiting to how this works. One replacement O-ring comes with the case-replacements from sony were outrageously expensive. Color-correcting (red) lenses are about $100 from sony, but not needed if you use a strobe. (unless maybe to shoot movies?)

I started with a D50 and have loved it from the very begining. I felt ready to step up to the next level, but didn't think I was ready for the d200. When I heard about the d80, I read everything I could. The biggest selling point was the fact that it was the same internal workings as the d200 in the more consumer friendly d50 body. I don't use all of the mode setting and find myself in Shutter and Aperture Priority most of the time, but it's nice to have the others there when I don't want to think about or have time to fiddle with settings.

The in camera image enhancements are amazing--but a word of caution. Vivid +2 will definitely give you vivid shots--if not too much so.

I've had this baby for about 2 weeks and imagine it will be my camera for the next couple years.

Compared to the Canon 30d (which I was thinking about) or even the new 400d (I haven't actually held one yet), this is the Nikon to have.

On batter life, I had a recent shoot where I took over 800 shots in a 3 hour period. The battery was at about half and that's with quite a bit of LCD viewing.

At this level both Canon and Nikon offer great equipment--you can't go wrong with either. Just get one of each in your hands, snap a few shots, and go with the one that feels the best for you

After way too much time infront of a PC reading reviews or a camera store counter (damn I was sick of it), this D80 is what I chose. Bought it 2 weeks ago and then went on a 10 day trip West. After draging it everywhere I has not let me down. For the price its perfect. I'm still working out exactly how to make it work to its potential aswell as fighting understanding of other manufacturers camera layouts in my head) At work I have a Rebel Xt I bought last year as I need its compact casing. My Brother has the Canon D30 after he progressed from the XT and a friend on the west coast has the D200. Having experience both I still love what I chose. My biggest reason however for going again with Nikon was that I already have a N6006 film camera with a lens and my hope was I could use its Nikkor AF 35-105mm with this camera and give myself more options. After reading lots of reviews as to whether this was possible and finally taking the lens to a shop I found it worked fine. Experience in the field in the last 10 days has shown it does not work seemlessly buy that may well be me not the lens. The 2.5 inch LCD is sooo much easier to read than the Rebel XT. The info read out on top is much better placed than the one above the LCD on the XT (if obstructed in an architectural model shoot and I can't see through the viewfinder myself, I certainly can't see the info screen if its below it). I didn't go with the 18-135 in the end for a lens as there is a vinyetting issue at the high end which bothered me. I got a great deal for the same price at Cameraland in New Hampshire for the D80 and the  (D70s) 18-70mm tried and trusted lens. Fab. Now need to save up and wait for the release of the  80-300 VR lens thats coming out. Would love the 80-400 Vr but its 3 times the price.
My hardest time was finiding someone with it in stock, at a price I wanted to pay, the set up I wanted and who wasn't trying to make a dodgie deal (like some of those cheap web based places in NYC).It really was the hardest part of the purchase in the end. I was surprised. Many people were almost reluctant to make a sale. It was wierd. Parts are hard to get too apparently like a spare battery and very few places have the 18-135 lens instock either.    
Anyway enjoy your purchase if you choose this camera. I hope it takes many great pictures for you.

First of all I do not consider myself anything more than a very beginning photographer !!! So I will not go into anything technical.  I will leave that to people who know more than I do. But what I am is an international traveler.  I simply got tired of coming home from fantastic trips with "snapshots".  I wanted someting much better, and boy did I get it with this camera.  I looked at the D70s and since I have very small hands, I could never feel comfortable holding it.  This camera is smaller without being small.  I have only taken photos locally, but at this time of the year with the leaves changing it makes a good start.  The built in editing features (filters etc.) are wonderful to work with.  I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who wants something more than "point and shoot" snap shots

I am by no means a pro at taking pictures, but this camera makes me look close to it. So far I have just used it as a point and shoot and the pictures have been of really good quality. I am tring to learn more of the functions and one I have run across so far that I enjoy is you can choose in certain functions for your photo to be black and white, color, or sepia. I am not high tech but I can use this camera pretty easily. My first digital camera was a canon digital elf with only 3.2 mega pixels and there is a huge difference in the quality of the pictures when you compare. So if you can affored to spend more for more mega pixels do it. The only down sides I have seen so far is it doesn't come w/ a great memory card which most do not and I imagine if I did not have small hands that the camera would be a little awkward to handle. It has lots of buttons and dials so you have to hold just right so that you don't hit any. But overal I am very satisfied w/ my purchase and hope to become a better photographer with the help of this camera. Canon cameras have served my family and I very well over the years

I am certainly happy I bought this filter kit. For a starting photographer, the price was right, and I have not noticed any quality issues. The UV filter stays on a lens at all times, as it's cheaper to replace the filter, than it is to have a scratched lens element repaired. 

The light polarizer is very handy, and also works very well, cutting down greatly on glare.

I have not yet had the occasion to use the warming filter yet. 

The filter case is a nice extra, it fits right in my camera bag, and is out of the way untill I need it

This is one of the best bargains that i've seen, "essentially" you get 3 filters for the price of one.  The image quality with these filters is great, the 812 (warming) filter is by far a favorite giving back the color richness that flash photography so often washes out, that is unless you have the patience for constantly tweaking your flash power.  Aside from the 812 the UV protector is basically a clear protective filter.  While it obviously has advantages over clear glass, I tend not to think of it as any different.  This too is a great filter which I use about half the time because it doesn't affect color hues or change f stop values too greatly while it takes the worry out of carrying the camera around ready for any candid shots that may occur.  Finally included is the circular polarizer. This filter adjusts the amount of uv light entering the camera by spinning the filter to the direction the uv rays are entering (or turning the thingy till things look better). This lens is great for sunny days and will take surface glare off lakes and glass making them transparent again.  It also makes colors more crisp in general when photographing buildings and other large "reflective" man-made things. So things sound great so far, but now to why I only give this item 4 stars.  While Tiffen is known to be one of the best at photo and video filters, they have quality control issues that do no live up to thier reputation.  In my case the 812 filter arrived with a discoloration in the glass.  While it was didn't hurt image quality, with the flaw being towards the edge of the filter, I none the less didn't want to find a situation in which the flaw would diminish quality.  Seeing as it was not amazon's fault my first e-mail went to Tiffen for a replacement which they said they would gladly do, but only after I send them the filter and they recieve it would they ship my replacement (not an option in my circumstances).  Instead Amazon's wonderful customer service shown through again, and within 3 days they had replaced the entire set.  The second set arrivided without flaw but since my other two filters were in perfect condition I traded just the 812.  I havn't had any other issues and i'm very satisfied with my filters. The only other word of warning would be to that of the circular polorizer. While I recieved 2 that were flawless occassionally I have read in reviews customers have received ones that were assembled backwards making the lens useless. A quick way to check to see if your CP is working correctly is to hold it, thread facing yourself, and look at an LCD monitor or TV and spin it until the picture dissapears(obviously working correctly). I still wouldn't pass up this deal knowing what I do now, chances are everything will show up perfectly but none the less if you're concerned order it before you need it and check everything over carefully. Amazon is always the best for returns and will often ship a replacement the next day with overnight shipping

Well, I've had my Rebel Xti for about 6weeks now, and all i can say is wow!!! I did have the Rebel Xt, which was an awesome camera.  I'm not a professional, but i do take pictures of what ever it may be outside or inside, youth or adult events as a hobby.  This camera is not for the person who wants to just point and shoot or to have a camera to stuff in your pocket.  This camera is for the creative person who wants control of the pictures they are taking.  The sensor cleaner and wide LCD are just a few of the wonderful advances from the XT to the XTI. The camera for me is easy to use and takes great pictures in auto mode or in my mode. 
I hope this helps you in your decision whether to buy or not.

I searched and researched the lens to purchase with my Canon Rebel XTI for weeks because I knew that I did not want the kit lens. I also did not have the money to spend on a 5, 6, or $700 dollar lens. In the end after reading countless reviews, ones implementing professional techniques and ones using just opinion, this lens looked to be the best value. For the money I really don't think that you can beat this lens. It focuses quickly, it is really quiet while doing it, and it is sharp enough for the money. Plus it has full time manual focus, which is a really big plus for a lens in this price range. The only problem is it is a little on the narrow side with the 1.6 crop factor on the Rebel XTI, but I would much rather have to deal with that than a sub-par image. In summary I would recommend this lens in place of the kit lens to anyone who doesn't have the money to buy an "L" series lens. It is really a great value

Every picture of mine that included larger portions of the sky would have these stubborn spores on it. Pretty infuriating, especially when you got the shot just like you wanted it. Yes, you can always remove those on Photoshop (or cheaper yet, The Gimp); but isn't it cool when you look at a picture and say: "that is it, nothing to do on it!" ??

And it wasn't just the sky. Any off-white but light plain colored background would suffer visibly from the acursed specks.

With this blower, greatly priced (pity that Adorama doesn't have free shipping though), I put my camera on the tripod, pointed it down, squirted three or four times - and gone are the specs!!!

Great buy for DSLR owners

I just bought a digital rebel about a month ago.  Love the camera, my old 380EX speedlight integrates with the camera but just doesn't offer enough cycle speed to keep up with continuous mode on the Rebel. This flash does the job for the Rebel and the plug for the external battery pack promises even better performance once I grab that item.  Another big selling point that really makes this unit worth the cash, is that it has its own infrared focus assist lamp which the digital Rebel lacks.  When this flash is mounted on your digital rebel, you don't get that annoying set of quick flashes that the camera has to set off to focus in low light when using the built-in flash.  The Rebel body uses the infrared focus assist on the 550EX to focus the lens; this feature alone is worth the big bucks this baby costs.  The flash has tons of features that most of us might never use, but as a advanced amateur I'm glad they're there so I can play with that if I should choose to try out some fancy stuff.  The wireless slave capability is handy but you've got to have at least one more 420EX, 550EX or 580EX to use that. I like the digital readout on the back of the flash and also the two way bounce head, it's important to note that you have to press a button to make the head turn either side to side or up/down---this should make the head sturdier than I've seen on some units that get loose after awhile and drive you nuts. This unit is a HONKER--really big, and, no lightweight either.  Get yourself a big deep camera bag if you want to lug this thing around with you.  What's the difference between this and the 580EX? The 580 has very slightly faster cycle times and offers some fancy new automatic flash exposure bracketing modes, for me anyway it wasn't worth almost two hundred dollars more for the 580. All of the newer EOS camera bodies are fully supported by this unit, it also works on older EOS bodies but there are functions available on the newer ones that aren't there on older stuff.  I like this flash it covers well, cycles fast and the controls are fairly intuitive and easy to use.  When you get yours don't lose that book, Canon doesn't seem to have them online anywhere I can find and I've seen places that want to charge you 18 bucks for a new one

This is one fantastic flash.  I had it on my Canon A2e for four years, and was ambivilent, but if you match this lens with one of Canon's newer bodies that has the funcionality to access all of the 550EX's features, you have an awesome, powerful, flexable flash that can change the way you shoot

Im a graphic design student in college, so i really needed a camera. I decided on this one and i am really glad i did. The pictures are nice and clean. The camera itslef is a very sleek looking one and is very compact. The only downfall to this is that it eats batteries pretty quick, but i just took them out when i wasnt using them. Buy this camera

This isn't a full review but some thoughts I've had after using it for a long time.
Stabilization- The fact is that if this is the camera you take everywhere with you, you are going to either lose shots or have to use the flash. If flash doesn't bother you, no sweat. But I've never like the look of it.
Ease-of-use- Great.
Voice memo- I use this feature all the time. It would be nice if it had a pause button because without it I end up with many small files.
Ex- This is where you set the exposure. Casio does a great job putting everything in one place. The only thing they should have done better is that if you have changed a selection (e.g. ISO 200 to 400) and hit the shutter release it should take the shot. Instead nothing happens. You have to click set first. It's an extra step that you have to make during a critical time

After checking prices with all the usual pricing bots, I found a better price, including free shipping, by going directly to Amazon. This lowest price did not appear in the other searches, so it pays to go to Amazon first.

I replaced my Canon SD400 with the Casio and find the controls more logical to use. This is important if you don't use the camera for a while, because you can just pick it up and start shooting without hunting for the manual. Also, the docking base is much more convenient than plugging small cables into the camera. You do not have to remove the battery in the Casio to charge it as you do with the Canon SD400. The VGA movie quality is superior on the Casio. Still pictures appear to be about equal. 

Amazon delivered by UPS in record time even with a weekend inbetween. I ordered on a Friday and received it the following Tuesday. Go with Amazon!

This was one of the first lenses that I purchased with my Rebel XT.  Now after taking several thousand pictures with it I can honestly say it was well worth the cost.  I very rarely have any unsharp pictures with this lens unless it is my own fault by trying to use too slow of a shutter speed without a tripod.

I also have the 180mm f/3.5L Macro Lens, which costs about 3 times more than this lens, and although it is very clear and the extra reach is nice at times especially since it can be used with both the 1.4X and 2X TC's, it is very difficult to use inside without a tripod.  The 60mm can be handheld if needed with very good results even if you have to bump your ISO up a little to do so.

I have also used this lens for both inside and outside portrait work with very nice results.

All-in-all, given it's small size and light weight I very rarely leave this lens behind when I go out because you never know when you might see a great macro shot

For its time and price (at the time), a fantastic camera.  6.3 MP is more than sufficient for most amateur and semi-pro (non-studio) work, and this camera works very well with what really matters:  Canon's fantastic lenses.  Battery life on this camera is very good.  The "shutter lag" (between when you depress the button and when the camera actually takes a photo) is fairly well non-existent, and the only real lag I have is when I am shooting multiple photos in RAW format.  As most photographers know, the lens is almost more important than the body, and outside of Leica lenses, I don't think anything really competes with Canon's line.  The 18-55 lens that comes with this camera is sufficient for casual work...I used it at the beach, and on hikes with my dog, when I don't want to lug around my bigger, more expensive, higher-quality lenses.  But for $75 or so, you can have a 50mm 1.8 EOS lens, which will supplement the 18-55 nicely, particularly for night photography.

My one complaint about this camera is its ability to meter light adequately in dark settings.  When I shoot RAW this isn't such a big problem, because I can fix it in Photoshop, but most everything I shoot inside, unless I manually mess with the white balance every time, has an orange tint that is interesting for the first 200 shots, and then is annoying after.  I think the more advanced EOS models that have come out since 2004 or so fix this color problem, and also help a bit with the lag between the RAW shots...but for the money, this camera is excellent, and far, far superior to, for example, Olympus' digital exquivalent (for a similar price).  The difference, as far as I'm concerned, is in the absolute advantage Canon has in lens quality.  You can use a high-end consumer body like this one, use a professional piece of Canon glass (lens) and take excellent photos.  I wouldn't invest in a system that doesn't also boast excellent lens quality

There are already tons of reviews on the EOS 300d (Digital Rebel) but I do want to share my experience with the camera, so I will keep this short. I bought this camera about 5 months ago and I am in love with. I was not new to photography or to SLR's, but new to the world of digital SLR. I had previously used an ancient Minolta x-570, a "pro-sumer" 35mm film slr with a Vivitar 35-105 standard zoom lens. First and foremost this camera takes excellent pictures, very high quality and no distortion that I have seen. This camera is particularly good as a beginner's dSLR because there are so many options to use and learn. But until you are ready to take advantage of all the featues, you can use this just like a point and shoot. Battery life has been excellent so far: thought I would suggest getting an extra to have as  a backup for long days of taking photos.  I have also been quite happy with the kit lens, which I wasn't sure I would like since it is not as versatile as the lens I had been using on my Minolta. But the kit lens has proved to be a great learning tool: I have been able to take some great shots, while also learning what kinds of other, better lenses I would like to add to my setup.
 
**The only issue I have had was a problem with a Sandisk 2gb CF card. After about 300 shots, the camera froze and stopped responding to that card. I was able to salvage most of the photos after the fact, but don't risk it. If you're serious enough to spend this kind of money on a camera, spend a little extra money on the Sandisk Ultra II line of high-speed cards.

I took this with me recently to Australia and shot landscapes as well as others, and the pictures came out better than the film cameras I have used recently, plus you don't need a scanner.  This camera works great, a must have for semi-pros.  Pros, wait for the new 1D.  Pictures come out great at 11&amp;quot;x17&amp;quot;

This camera is amazing. Out of the 3 digital camera's under $150 I've used, this is by far the best, beating out the Kodak and the SiPix. I originally bought the SiPix, and it was junk. Don't buy the SiPix that's under $150. The Kodak for some reason didn't seem like it took as good pictures as the FinePix, but the software was a little better, being from Kodak. 

This camera can take pictures of resolution up to 2 megapixels, but I don't even use that option because the 1 megapixel pictures are so amazing. It comes with a 16MB removable memory card, so you can take around 49 pics at 1MP, around 24 at 2MP, and it takes short videos for about 30 seconds in mpeg format at a 320 x 160 resolution, or more on a lower setting. The LCD screen can easily be turned on or off to save battery power, and the 2 AA batteries it takes lasts pretty long. It has a nice, sleak design, and the software has no issues with windows XP at least. 

The only cons I could think of are that the only zoom it has is 2X digital zoom, which is pretty much useless, and I never use it, since it's the same thing as zooming in with your picture viewer on your computer. So you can consider it not having any zoom. The software for it works well, but it could be better, options wise. The filenames of the pictures will default to a number depending on its order on the memory card, so if you transfer pics to your computer more than once in a day (since it creates folders based on date), you'll have to rename each pic. But I hardly complain, since the pictures come out so incredibly well. 

I'm so happy with this camera! If you want a camera under $150, this is the one to get. Don't even waste your time with the Kodak, unless you want the one with 3X optical zoom, but that's $200. I use it for general purpose, taking pictures of freinds and such. Once in a while I take a picture of a sunset at 2MP, and that will be photo quality printed on a full page. 1MP creates crisp and clear desktop wallpaper size images, and .3MP will created good smaller images to put on websites. There's no reason to buy anything else, go with the Fuji FinePix A200!

I got this camera for my 17th birthday last summer, and it's great. As much as I'd love to have a Canon Powershot, it's a bit out of my price range. All the people who think that using the LCD screen runs out the batteries after &amp;quot;2-4 pictures&amp;quot; are lying to you. I bought rechargable batteries from radioshack, and I've taken up to 400 picture without the batteries needing to be changed. This is a good camera with good quality in good lighting. In dark or overcast situations, it can look a bit grainy, but that's easily photoshopped. I recommend that when uploading, plug it into the wall with a digital camera adapter, because uploading sucks all battery power right out. I recommend this for someone who hasn't owned a digital camera before, or for someone that wants good quality at a not-so-crazy price

I highly recommend the Raynox DCR 1540Pro Teleconverter for the Canon S2 instead of the Canon branded one.   Hoya makes a 67mm UV filter for this and both are available at Lensmate.com.   The Canon WC-DC58A wide angle converter however is really good.  Tiffen made a better one but it seems to not be available anymore.   
By the way, the function that the S2 provides for settings using the lens adaptors and teleconvertors are to adjust for the AutoFocus function of the camera and are necessary unless you wish to try to focus yourself using the manual focus which, in my mind, because of the LCD both in the screen as well as in the viewfinder with a lower resolution than an optical viewfinder, is iffy at best.   Trust the camera.....it really does an excellent job.   One final note, I would recommend using the Focus Bracketing option in lower light situations as the Auto Focus is weak in those situations.

This lens does exactly what it should. The overall quality is extremely good. Take a look at my photos:

- First photo is without the lens
- Second photo is with the lens and flash
- Third photo is with the lens and without flash

There are a few things to note about the photos:

- There is a substantial amount of barrel distortion. This is normal. Try not to have straight lines near the borders of the photo to make it less obvious.

- Fringing is exaggerated. You notice fringing (purple or blue tints) along high contrast edges of objects that are near the borders. You can see this on regular shots but is more exaggerated with the wide angle lens.

- The lens makes a shadow when using the built-in flash. You can see the shadow in the photo with the flash. In a darker environment, it is very obvious. The external flash is the only way to fix this.

A couple details:

- You can get an extender that is a nice brushed aluminum here:

http://www.lensmateonline.com/S2.html

- The camera has a setting (Converter) to indicate that you have the lens attached. It's not obvious what it does but it is indicated by a change in the image stabilization icon so I assume that it affects the way that image stabilization works.

Overall, I recommend this lens

I'm still learning to use this camera and all the features. So far it is amazing. I've been taking pictures of the kids and it looks like a pro did the shots. I use the auto mode a lot and it works great. The zoom is amazing. I love that it tells me when I am focused. Also it has great battery life. I'm very happy with this camera

This tripod was a total shock! I was amazed at the quality, stability and portability. The heavy duty denier carrying case is a great bonus. The level and quick release were also a welcome surprise. This was the best $9.00 I ever spent for photography accessories.

The previous review is not completely correct. The problem is not with the product but with the description what amazon.com put up for the Canon CPM-E3 Battery Magazine. It is a battery magazine for the Canon Compact Battery Pack CP-E3 and not for the camera battery grip. I think the product itself is a great thing, it lets you switch the whole magazine with 8 preloaded batteries instead replacing the batteries in the Canon Compact Battery Pack CP-E3.
The previous reviewer should not judge a product by the incorrect infromation given by a retailer

Easy, fast and serius tool, for cleaning your optics.  The easy use is discribe in the manual that is very clear to understand.  Cleaning is fast with the Nikon lens pen, cuase it has the necesary to do the job well done, as any profesional tool.  Now I have 2 of them, for my two camera bags.

Great flash, all the good qualities of the SB800 but less of the data dump and decision quagmire! It has the built in flash disperser, its lighter than the 800, so unless you're into more info than you need, go with the SB600. Oh, it has a shorter recycle time too.

Canon has three digital cameras for $2,500+. The 1DS Mark II, the 1D Mark IIN and the relatively new 5D. I chose Canon over Nikon (which I've shot most of my photographic life) because of Canon's more impressive suite of lenses. Here's the decision process I went through. As with most products, it comes down to how you'll use it. All of them have tradeoffs.

1. Megapixels. More pixels - with a few caveats - translates into an image that can be enlarged (and cropped more tightly)with less deterioration. The 1DS is the market leader at 16.7MP, the 5D comes in at 12.7MP and the 1D at 8.2MP. If you're a commercial art or magazine photographer the 1DS probably makes sense. If you're a wedding photographer, the 5D is probably the sweet spot. In practice, however, the difference in pixels between these cameras will not make an appreciable difference for most people. At 8.2MP, you can make an 11x17 print at 200 pixels/inch without any enlargement beyond the camera's native resolution. Up to that size, you certainly won't see much difference in prints from the three cameras. That said, the higher megapixels of the other cameras gives you more extreme cropping lattitude. 

2. Full frame. The 1DS and 5D are full frame - that means the sensor in the camera will capture the view of the scene that you're accustomed to seeing with your 35 mm film camera. The 1D and most digital cameras have what is called a field of view crop factor (FOVCF). For the 1D, it's 1.3X. What that means is that both the viewfinder and the image sensor don't capture everying the lens is "seeing" - it crops the view in a little tighter. The result: your lenses are effectively 1.3X longer. A 70 mm lens becomes a 91 mm lens and so on. Because the camera is effectively "cropping" the edges of the image that the lens produces, it also tends to eliminate the softness or vignetting that appears at the edges of some lenses. Whatever camera you use, what you see in the viewfinder is still what you get, and it doesn't affect the pixel resolution of the image. My 300 mm lens with a 1.4X extender and a 1.3X FOVCF is effectively a 546 mm lens - getting into birding territory. (If you're switching from film to digital, some of your lenses may may no longer fit your needs with the FOCVF. Your 35 mm lens is no longer really a wide angle at 45 mm.)

3. Durability. This was most important to me, though it may not be for someone who doesn't shoot in extreme conditions or expects to replace their camera in two years. Both the 1Ds and 1D sport complete metal bodies, sealed against the weather with a shutter that will last at least 200,000 cycles. The 5D - a very solid camera - is designed for 100,000, is not weather sealed and has more plastic components.

4. Weight/size. What a solid, metal body giveth in durability it taketh away in weight. For those who prefer a camera with heft, these have it. For many people, this is a big drawback. The 1DS and 1D are 43 oz., or almost three pounds for just the body, without the big battery. Add the battery and you're at 54 oz. The 5D is just 29 oz. and 31 oz. with battery. The 1DS and 1D, with built-in vertical grips, are also more than 2 inches taller. If you're looking for something less obtrusive and easier to carry around, the 5D is it.

5. Speed. There's a reason the 1D is the camera of choice for photojournalists, sports and many bird photographers. It shoots at a smooth 8.5 frames per second, compared to 4 fps for the 1DS and 3 fps for the 5D. For most day-to-day uses, 3 fps is more than adequate. From using both, I'd say the 1D autofocuses a bit faster, too. The 1D has 45 autofocus points, compared to nine for the 5D.

6. Price. Give or take a hundred here or there, the 1DS is about $7,200; the 1D about $3,900; and the 5D about $3,000. Price will determine whether you get the 1DS or not. If you can afford it, go for it. Otherwise, other features - or the possiblity of buying more lenses instead of more camera - will make your decision.

What did I decide? First, I looked at how I'd use the camera: photojournalism, travel and wildlife photography. The higher FPS was not as important to me as durability and autofocus speed, so either the 1D or 1DS would do. In the end, I decided I'd rather spend the money on lenses that would not be obsolete with the next new and improved camera. (I bought the 300 f/2.8 IS for close to the difference in price.)

So, I went with the 1D Mark IIN. If my camera was generating some good cash flow or my wife didn't need a new car, I'd probably have gone with the 1DS. I'm VERY happing with the decision and the camera.

For most people and most uses - general portrait, landscape and travel photography - the 5D is probably the way to go. (Or perhaps the next greatest camera that Canon will announce later this year.

Yep, it extends the eyepiece out a little bit ... which helps those of us with noses not smudge the lcd display ... but it also distorts the view in an annoying way.

I bought the 250D lens to use with my Sony DSC-F717 and it is just wonderful. I can also use it with my Canon G3 because I bought a Canon LADC58B Conversion Lens Adapter (which is required and is inexpensive). 

I had been hearing a lot of good things about this lens in digital photography forums and I have seen many wonderful examples of its use. 

I recommend this lens to anyone who wants to make their "macro" photography shine. Get one! 

Just be clear that there is the 52mm and the 58mm and don't be confused as to which one will fit your camera.

Edit: 

Just a clarification: 

This one 'is' the "58mm" even though above (on this page) when you click the links "See More Technical Details" and "See all Product Description" it mentions "52mm". This is misleading and confusing. At the very very top of this page it says "58mm". Let me just assure you that this particular one 'is' the "58mm" and 'is not' the "52mm".

late edit (Aug 04, 06):
Well, it looks as if Amazon finally corrected that misleading info I mentioned just above in my clarification

This is just a plain sweetheart of a lens.  It covers the useful 18-35 mm range (which is 27-52mm on a Nikon digital SLR, which is a VERY useful range).  This lens costs less than half the price of the (expensive) professional Nikon 17-35, and does almost as nice a job. Sufficiently nice, in fact, that most amateurs will not discern much, if any, difference.   While not built like a tank, I think that the quality of construction on this one is excellent, and more than adequate for enthusiastic amateurs and even some pros.

On a Nikon digital SLR, which will use the center portion of this lens (due to the size of the sensor in the SLR) you can expect excellent, even spectacular results.  This is a fabulous lens for landscape and nature shots, portraits, or just plain walking around taking pictures.  Someone who only wanted one lens that was not a telephoto could do much worse than to select this excellent, versatile lens.  This one is great for parties, vacations, and the works.

The images I have shot with this lens have all featured superb contrast, are very sharp, and have beautiful color rendition.  There just is not a lot not to like about this lens. I give it 4 stars for overall performance, but 5 stars for value and price/performance.  Some lenses just get it all together and work and become keepers.  This is one of those

Well, besides a whole bucket full of money, one of them lets you take photos in lower light, okay, that's obvious. The 16-35mm is a bit heavier, but not so you'd notice, unless maybe you were carrying it around all day, without eating and you're a bit over the hill. So why pay the extra money, unless, of course, you do a lot of shooting in the early morning and late evening?

 Maybe you shouldn't, because I've been doing a lot of photo taking with both, film and digital, and as one would expect from the "L" lenses, the photos are crisp and sharp. In fact I keep I the 17-40 on the camera I carry around all day, you know, the one I might leave on the table in a restaurant when I got to the restroom. It's a lot less money to lose to someone looking for a five finger discount. However, my gal pal Sara and I take a lot of early morning photos. She shoots old houses, and she never, ever goes out without the 16-35mm. She swears by it, loves it, sometimes I think better than me.

So there is a difference, I'm the kind of person that could happily live with less expensive lense, Sara is not. However they both deliver gorgeous photos. You can't go wrong if the lense has that red circle around it.

I love the new digital Canon. The only problem is it's not nearly as tough as it's film twin.  I had the camera less than a month when the pop-up flash quit working.  The Canon people have been great, and very helpful, but I'd rather not have had to send a brand new camera back to the factory.  The photos, however, are wonderful.  Film quality for the most part - printable and enlargable.  (It would probably be better to use the camera with a tripod when using the 300mm telephoto but I hike with it, so just remember to steady it before taking wildlife photos.

When I bought this camera the sales people tried to get me to buy another battery.  They said the one that came with it would only be good for about 20 minutes.  Now I have bought alot of items in my lifetime, a 20 min battery on a camera just doesnt seem like a very good "business" choice.  So I said no.  So I got the camera, charged the battery until the light went green (which sucked because I wanted to play with it right when i got it) and started taking pictures (oh I also got a 2G CF) worked great....so I planned to go up a mountain and take soem scenery shots.  Keeping in mind what the sales person had told me I pocketed the charger just incase.  Well, 6000', 300 pictures, and 5 hours later the camera is still running strong, still have 200 shots left for the trip home, battery life indicator hasnt budged off of the full button.  So all in all, I think the battery life is great, now i can see if your taking say thousands of pictures all in a row you may need another but for just going on a trip and shooting a few pictures at every stop point, the original will work fine.  as for the quality of photos.....i love them

This is the first SLR camera that I have ever owned.  I bought it because I was going on a trip around the world, wanted a nice camera, and had it recommended by a camera shop owner.   It is extremely easy to use, so easy that I could hand the camera to someone in one of the countries I visited, point to the button they needed to push and I ended up with a great picture.  I didn't need to explain a thing.  I also didn't mind carrying it around all day, it is very light for its size.  

 I have owned the camera for four years now and it still takes beautiful pictures.  I have taken all sorts of pictures with this camera, from landscapes to action shots and they all turn out great.  The action shots are never blurry!  The only complaint that I have is that the autofocus does not work well in low lighting, sometimes it is slow and sometimes it won't work at all.  In these cases I just turn on the manual focus option.

All the options that the camera has are great, but to be honest I rarely use them.  I've found that it is often easier to use manual focus than to adjust the camera so it will autofocus off center.  If I know that I'm going to be taking action shots or landscapes I will set the camera to that mode, but often I forget and my pictures still look great.

I think that this is an excellent camera, especially for someone that is used to a point and shoot but wants the extra quality that a SLR camera can give them.  There are also many choices when it comes to additional lenses, so when the photography bug gets you, this camera can stay with you

The Canon RS-60E3 is all that Canon says it is....it is a simple one handed operation switch that can open the flash, focus, then release the shutter once, a multiple of times, or hold it open for bulb exposure.  Although the cord is not long enough to include the photographer in the picture, it was simple enough to make an "extension" that allows for very remote exposures

The fisheye lens is a lot of fun, and I enjoy using mine.  However, I find that the practicality of the lens is minimal.  I don't usually want my "serious" photographs to have fisheye distortion.

I don't tend to like the 1.6x crop on Canon's lower-end digital SLR cameras, but with the fisheye this has an interesting benefit:  it's reasonably easy to use the fisheye as a standard wide-angle lens, since most of the distortion is removed by the 1.6x crop.  You can still get distortion, but it's a lot easier to compose a shot without it using a 1.6x camera than a full-frame camera.

Either way, lots of fun.  Buy one for the enjoyment, or even for professional assignments if your work calls for it, but think about if you really want the distortion before getting one of these

Fits my Canon SD550 perfectly and no complains abt that. The quality of the product is pretty good. When used with the belt clip, its easy to open and easy to put the camera back.  Camera seems very secured when used with the belt clip.

Though the lenses for my Nikon D50 were not as expensive as some can be they still were several hundred dollars and having this UV Protection Filter protecting the lens glass made a whole lot of sense. I feel less stress when I clean the filter lens than if I was wiping dust and dirt from the actual lens glass. This size, 52mm, was what was specified for my D50 and it fits perfectly, as it should. I have no complaints at all with the manufacturer or the seller. If you are new to digital SLR's like I was then get this filter to protect your lens. And spend your time worrying about the sensor when you need to switch out your lens.

If you are looking for a great all around camera, this is it!  Our kids play sports and are in constant motion and the sports mode captures it all.  Also love the "Last 4" feature, gets some great action shots.  We had the Fuji 7000 before this and they have definately fixed the features that bugged me.  Love the new manual zoom (if you like 35mm lenses your like this) as well as the battery drain.  I used to have to replace batteries every day, now its more like once a week with the amount we use it.  My other favorite feature is the dual memory slots for those times where I forget to put it back in the camera after downloading!  So there is always one in there!.  The video comes out great and with the new manual lens you can zoom during video shots.  In general, without spending A LOT MORE, you get a great camera that keeps up with an active "picture happy" family

I, like many people, research high-tech purchases before buying because of the complexity of the items and the invariably high cost of some of the items.  Digital cameras are no exception.  I was looking for a replacement for my KonicaMinolta Dimage Z1.  My requirements were fairly straight forward:  the new camera had to have a 10x zoom, no less than a 5mp processing chip, and third, get my photography skills to the point that the camera after this new one could be a DSLR.  I have read the reviews here on Amazon regarding the performance of the S9000, and while some of them, I felt, were right on, others did not read the professional reviews before purchasing this camera.  The intended use of this camera has never been a point and shooter.  While the S9000 does possess automatic functions to "streamline" use, these features are whoafully inadequate for the overall optical and proccessing capibilities that Fuji strove for in it's design.  Let me for clarifications' sake say this loud and clear:  IF YOU WANT BREATHTAKINGLY BEAUTIFUL, CLEAR, VIBRANT PICTURES WITH PERFECT EXPOSURE USING THIS CAMERA, THEN YOU MUST USE THE MANUAL SETTINGS.  THIS IS NOT A POINT AND SHOOT TYPE OF A CAMERA!!!!!!  Out of the box the S9000 has been a Godsend.  Not only are the images super sharp with no hint of edge fall off that hampers other high res cameras, but the exposure is so perfect that I question my ability for luck.  The setups are very easy and the controls and functions are a snap.  The white balance and shutter speed settings are not easy concepts to grapple with in potography, and yet Fuji has made short work of them with their intuitive design.  There really are two photographic miracles at work in the S9000:  one, is the processor that captures detail and color that you feel guilty for paying so little for something that is better than much more expensive equipment, and two, is that the exposure is so good that if I did not know better, I would think that I was using an advanced film SLR.  This is an absolute rave for this product.  The fit and finish are superb, ergos are comfortable and controls easy to find and use, and it fulfilled my need for a camera that would get me ready for a DSLR but not be too complex.  The only downside to this camera is that it will take time to process the image before exposure, but outside of some DSLRs, this is a problem with all digital cameras.  It is true that this camera is big and heavy, but then photographic perfection ain't free.  Home Run FUJI!!

I will not repeat what other reviews have stated already, all the reviews below are pretty much correct with this camera being a high quality and easy to use etc etc.

The only issue is focusing on a small target such as a name brand logo inside a Rolex watch.  It is HARD even in Manual mode (and I actually have alot of digital camera experience).  Forget trying to focus in AUTO mode, it won't happen.. at least not without alot of tinkering and stress.  

If you need to take alot of close up pictures of small detailed items (jewelery, insects, etc.) then I recommend buying a digital SLR camera, Nikon D50 is a good one!  This Fuji you are looking at here is perfect for taking pictures of normal things like people, cars, buildings, sites, etc

 The black of this is the same as on my camera, and with all the parts together, this is one professional looking set up!
 I am not sure if this hood cuts down on glare/reflection, as I have not used it on a sunny day, but I don't see why it shouldn't.
 And as cheap as this little product is, it is pretty much a must have with this camera! (S3 IS)

 One last side note, should you alreay own a extra lens or two. And they happen to be metal, be VERY carful about screwing them into this plastic adaptor! I made that mistake and had to put the whole thing in the fridge for an hour, so the metal would shrink, and I could get the pieces apart

I bought this camera for my sister, as an early Christmas present, thinking I would need some time to set it up for her, well in less then 30 minutes I was ready, It's a awesome camera, I was impressed, of the ease from set up to formatting the 512 SD card. I have sent the site to another sister whom is interested. It is the easiest camera to use and has features that will impress anyone, Great photos from very close to far away. I would recommend this camera to anyone

Okay, first off, I'd like to say that this is my first AF SLR--I stepped up from my dinosaur of a camera, Canon AE-1 manual focus, and right now I am quite overwhelmed by all the features in this little thing.  I'm still in the learning stages of all this technology but let me tell you this, I am having fun!  It amazes me that Canon can offer quite an impressive camera for the price.  

I just received my first few rolls from the developer and the pictures came out amazing--so clear and the colors are very vibrant.  Just to let you know, I'm using the 28-105mm f/3.5-4.5 USM lens.  I took the suggestions of many and passed up on the "kit" lens and I'm sure glad I did so.  I would highly recommend the f/3.5-4.5 lens, but unfortunately for the rest of you, Amazon has discontinued it.  But you could order it from one of the many other photo shops (B&amp;H, Adorama, etc). 

Do I have any regrets on this purchase?  Absolutely not!  I love this camera and even though I've owned it for less than a month, I'm actually thinking about stepping up to the EOS 3 and using this as a backpacking/hiking body.  Hmm...what to do, what to do?  Do I purchase another body or start a collection of L-series glass?  ...that is the question.

The other day I used a friend's standard digital camera for a little while. The whole time I found myself missing the manual zoom, instant response and convient manual buttons on my D50. This camera takes amazing pictures. As an dSLR beginner I used the camera in Auto mode for the first several weeks, now after reading some books on photography I'm slowing starting to use the manual features. The D50 lets me choose the level of control that I'm comfortable with, from full manual to full automatic; and both options are just a turn of the dial away.

The body of this camera is built like a tank. Metal and high quality plastics abound. The buttons provide good feedback and the switches feel solid and durable. It is a beautiful piece of precision engineering

Not much to add to the other positive reviews posted, other than I am another user that loves my D50. Have had it for a year now and shot over 10,000 photos with excellent results (mostly landscape and wildlife).  Excellent image quality and the hand grip fits perfectly to both my hand and my husbands.
The only CON I can think of at this time is that there is no backlight on the top panel - this makes it difficult to adjust settings in low/ no light situations. Also, for people that are used to the little compact point &amp; shoot cameras this might seem a little overwhelming at first and bulky to carry around (which is why I have a little pocket camera for my purse). I also got the 18-200 lens and love it - perfect walk around lens

I needed a lens hood for my 50mm lens and paying $25 for a hood on a $75 lens might seem ridiculous. However, that might be because the $75 lens is so inexpensive. If the lens was $250 then paying an extra 10% might not seem too bad.  I just saw the total cost of the lens and hood for $100 and that's good for a terrific prime lens and its hood.  

However, please note: the lens hood is rather shallow (1 star reduction) and it is a screw-on two piece kit (1 star reduction). One piece is the adaptor that screws-on where the filters normally go (UV Filter) in front of the lens and is intended to be a permanent integral part of the lens and the second piece is the hood that snaps on and off this adaptor. The adaptor ring retains the same 52mm rim size so your protective filter can go before or after the adaptor.

(1 Bonus Star) Because $100 is still a bargain for a 50mm, f1.8, super fast, super sharp, super clear, light weight beginner lens and hood kit!

I hope this helps rather than confuse. :)

This kit is a must have for any of the compatible Canon cameras. Digital camera rule #1: ALWAYS carry a spare battery - the kit is almost worth it for  that alone. The leather case is great: stylish looks that provides a tough protective armor in case you drop the camera. The neck strap is quite strong and looks good too. It may not be everyone's cup of tea but I like it. It comes in handy when I need quick access to the camera and don't want to fumble through pockets or bags

Although this is a good batch of accessories, the camera case itself is a little unhandy at times.  It has no carry strap -- the camera strap sticks out through a slit in the top.  So, if you want to carry the case by a strap and you decide to take a picture, you must open the case, pull the camera's strap through the slit, then lift the camera out.  It would not keep me from buying this but it does make it unhandy

I have been working for a major daily newspaper in Baltimore for 2 decades. Perhaps that will qualify me as an expert in photography. I have been shooting digital imagery since the late 1990s. Maybe that qualifies me as an expert in digital photography. This may be long- winded, but it's extensive and can be useful. 
 
 I received the Nikon D2H camera -- 2 bodies total -- over one year ago. I think I got them shortly after the D2H system was released in 2003. Since then, I have used them to shoot images of all types -- documentary, sports, daytime, available light, flash, and dead- of- night -- for the paper I work for. This is the only camera I work with. 
 
 First, please read the manual. There is a ton of information there, and the information is terrific to begin with. The D2H is highly- configurable, with screen after screen that you can set for your own specific use (resist lending the camera to anyone for a long period of time, for your camera may be returned with many of your settings changed so much that it acts like a thoroughly different camera). 
 
 I'll just punch right in to the way it feels. The camera is a rather heavy beast, and for some, there can be an amount of shoulder or neck fatigue when using it for hours per day, like I do. But the camera feels well in hand and the controls are easy to move through. I've long since given up using any camera bag. All I have are a fanny pack for a 14mm, 55mm, teleconverters and 2 extra camera batteries and flashes clipped to its belt. And the D2H's hold the 17-35mm Nikon and the 80-200mm Nikon one- touch or the Sigma 120-300mm 2- touch. 
 
 Shooting is a breeze. The batteries let you shoot long before the need to recharge. I have my D2H set on ISO 200 or 400 most of the time and sacrifice shutter speed for lower ISO as often as I can, because the higher ISOs bring digital noise and a loss in color saturation. Just today, I purchased digital noise plug ins for Photoshop to limit this, and that's a wonderful thing to invest in with this camera when you must shoot action photography with no flash at ISO 800 and above. 
 
 I now have little problems with capturing images in even barely- limited lighting. I recently shot stars and a plane wing from my seat of an Airbus at 36,000 feet over the Pacific at 30 seconds wide open @ f/ 2.8, and it looks tons better than night shots via the D1H, which lacked the internal digital noise filter. That filter kicks in at around 1/2 second and longer exposures, and can make you wait as long as your image you've shot to strip your long exposure of much of the digital noise. When you shoot this way (and in general), don't simply react by cranking up ISO because you will not be happy with your results. 
 
 The camera can be loud. At over 7 frames per second, it can make you obvious in a quiet room. Shooting sensitive situations can be testy, so limit your shooting to single frames. I wish this camera had an option to silence this camera, but since the mirror has to raise and lower, there's no chance to do this. 
 
 Am I happy with the D2H? Definitely, yes. Are there improvements that can be made? Yes. But the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. People have been bailing out of using the Nikon system and going Canon, which has some incredible gear, I won't deny that. But instead of simply giving up on your system of equipment, learn how to use the D2H well and you'll be much happier than ever. And that means you should push its qualities to the max while respecting its limitations. 
 
 For instance, white balance. This can be the best thing for you, or the worst thing you've ever dealt with, depending upon how you approach it. Daylight, grey skies, dusk and dawn are easy, because you can set the camera to daylight, flash, shadow (for dusk and dawn times) and even the fluorescent and incandescent tend to be right in the ballpark. But the horrible mixed light or the street lamps that glow blue/green or orange- red from mercury vapor can be the death of an image if you don't properly use white balance. Preset white balance is king, here. I can get grey, black and white when I preset in mercury vapor light. And I used the preset for any light that the auto white balance setting can't figure. There is also a setting to dial in kelvin temps as well! If you do this (and I can go on for miles here), you're on your way. So, with trying this D2H, or considering it, read through some of the digital D2H forums and ignore the posts that slam the camera without giving instances. Generally, those who pan the camera have not tried to understand it. I can bang off images to disprove where they suggest this camera will fail. When you have decent light, you'll have a decent image. But when you try to use it without learning how you can maximize the system, you will come about shooting images that are terrible and unprintable. 
 
 In closing, I have not been paid by anyone, I have no Nikon stock and have no outside interest in writing this except that I'm giving the D2H credit where it's long overdue

Now that i have had this on my camera for a while now, my camera feels so weird with it off, i love the grip it gives and the extra battery life is great for those all day shooting events that i go to. I wish the buttons were the same plastic/chrome color as the ones on the camera but its a well built product and works fine so i cant complain

My 2 year old is really active and my point and shoot camera cannot keep up with him.  And I also don't like the washout look when I uses flash.  So I researched about which SLR will best meet my needs, mainly catching fast action, candid moments and low light photos without flash.  The Canon 30D comes up top on the list.  It has the best high ISO performance in its class (better than Nikon and Sony).  And when I combine the 30D with the fast zoom lens EF-S 17-55 mm f/2.8 IS, the result is amazing.  I can stop any action in daylight, capture every candid expression of my 2 yr old with the fast burst mode, and take indoor or night photos without using flash or tripod.  Portraits are also excellent with sharp image and beautifully blurred background (bokeh).  Even the dimly-lit decors of the Disneyland Haunted Mansion came out superb when we went there for the Halloween party at night, without flash or tripod.  This is really an important factor for me to buy this camera, as taking pictures with a tripod is not an option when your subject is an active 2 yr old.  But you will need a good lens to make this work well.  If you use a cheap kit lens, then it will probably not matter which camera you pick.  Remember that these 3 are all very good cameras and the small differences in image quality you see in reviews are apparent only when they use the best prime lens (not the kit lens)and crop the pictures to magnify the details.  The Sony is a very good choice if you are on a budget and don't need low light performance (use flash and save money).  The Nikon has more custom function than Canon, and it is really as good as Canon.  They both have their strength and weakness.  Canon just happens to have slightly better high ISO performance and that suits my need better than Nikon.  To be fair, I should mention that the Nikon D200 tops most reviews as the camera of the year, beating the Canon 30D overall.  But the D200 is a bit too advanced for an amateur like me, better suits someone more serious about photography.  The D80 is like a "mini" D200, but slower.  So it really boils down to what you really need and how much you want to spend.  Shooting in low light without flash will need good high ISO performance, a good fast lens (with wide aperture, usually expensive), and image stabilization.  If that's what you want, the Canon 30D with the EF-S 17-55 mm f/2.8 IS will not disappoint you

This can be a very easy to use camera. Simply by using the auto mode and composing your pictures properly you can get very good JPEG images. It also can be about as complicated as you want to make it. It has many advanced features on it. I have been shooting 35mm for about 32 years. My most recent before this one being an Elan II E about 7 years ago. It's still working also. The 30d is my first digital and I absolutely love the camera. I generally work in the aperture priority mode with a tripod at 100 ISO when shooting landscape. But, the camera is very capable in auto mode as well without the tripod. I like to shoot RAW so that I can tweek things a bit, but the JPEG images are very acceptable. It also works extremely well for portraits. It actually is better than the 35mm to me because it has very low noise even at higher ISOs. 1600 looks about like 800 film to me. This is a very good value for the money in my opinion

I upgraded from the Canon Digital Rebel (grey body) to this because I was ready to take my photography to a new level. One thing I like most about this camera is it's flash compenstation. I purchased the 430ex flash with it because I was tired of having to use the built in flash and always getting those hard shadows on the wall

Be careful when you use this lens because it does not have IS (image stabilizer) so if you have shaky hands and the exposure is any more than 1/8 of a second you are going to going to get some blur. This is why the lens is so cheap. This is especially bad when you are at the far end spectrum of this lens. If you are really zoomed in and it's cloudy then you should know to use a tripod just in case. This goes for any lens, but if you will be using the 300-mm end of this then use a tripod. 

It's common sense, but I've loaned out this lens and they complained to me afterwards

This is the same charger came with my digital rebel, however, I like to charge two batteries at a time. So, I bought a second charger and place them side by side on the power strip. 

The prongs for the outlet fold over and into the back of the charger making the charger very compact, flat and easy to take along with you. It's nice having a charger without long cords to fuss with.

I have been using this lens for about 2.5 years and it is an exceptional piece of equipment, especially for the price!
I very rarely feel the need to get a closer image than I can achieve with this lens.  
It's very solidly built and I am sure it will continue to be a primary piece in my kit for years to come

I am THRILLED with this lens's capabilities and the pictures it does.  I test shot a corner of a window to determine if it would be good for my insect shots that I like so well.

Well, it did great as it came but I found that I wanted to have the 1/1 capability so I bought the add-on converter and am thrilled to have added both of these necessary items for my set-up.  I like nature photography the best and like to use my off summer days for hiking and finding photographs to take in perhaps well-known places but finding unique angles and subjects is what I like to specialize in.  This lens will greatly enhance your experience in that 'little world' we commonly trod over or weed-ate away.  I built a diffuser using a ping-pong ball over the flash so the lighting would work better.  (Works great, btw).

As usual, it's great Canon glass that does the trick

I purchased this lens to take photographs of vintage wristwatches.  I use an original Canon Digital Rebel and the shots are really very detailed.  It is easy to use in fact, I can hand hold the camera and capture the details in the hand-made craftsmanship of the watches.  Its F2.5 opening is a welcome change when you are use to shooting with a zoom lens and it is quite sharp edge to edge.  If you own a Canon digital SLR and want to pocket some extra coin then this is the lens for you.

I have used this charger &amp; battery package for a while now in my digital SLR, battery performance is excellent! The downside is that the charger has issues: The top bay charges faster than the bottom bay and the batteries get VERY hot when charging, it has not seemed to affect the batteries in the year I have had them. If you are looking for exceptional batteries buy these, and the charger is okay, just beware that it does not charge all NiMH batteries but does do most

I don't have that much stuff, but fits all my DSLR gadgets plus my camcorder.

Fits 
- my Canon Xti with my canon 50 mm attached.
- my kit lens
- my new canon 70-300 IS
- my panasonic video cam
- minor accessories (extra batteries, cables, memory cards, etc)

There are separators with velcros inside, so you can configure the bag however you want it.

The only issue I have with this bag is that I wan't able to configure it to store my Xti with my 70-300 attached

This is a good Teleconverter that added 1.5x to the camera's native zoom. It adds a great degree of stability to the camera for taking those critical shots. Of course when the digital zoom is used it is very sensitive to shake and movement. Overall a good addition especially for the birds and nature shots

If you have the big lenses (400mm f/2.8L IS USM or even the 70-200mm f/2.8L IS USM) this is totally worth the addition. The 2x does NOT kill the autofocus on the f/2.8 and effectively doubles your lens with very little distortion around the edges. Check compatability on Canon's website. You won't be disappointed

Purchased a printer dock and camera bundle, from a local office supply store for $100. It only came with a 10 picture sample cartridge, so I purchsed this from amazon. Amazon had the best price around on this item and free shipping. It works great. No complaints. The paper is not quite as shiny and or as thick as the epson photo glossy paper that I still use for some pictures, but works well for my classroom, to give to my students. The pictures do not run like some inkjet pictures do if you accidentally drip water on them

I am 67 years old and started out in photography as a kid with a contact printer and a box camera. I have had all types of cameras over the years, mostly 35mm film Canon slr's. I too bought all sorts of these 5-7 MP point and shoot digital cameras before returning to my true love, SLR's. I have had my digital Canon Rebel XT about a month now and I can't keep my hands off of it. It lacks nothing. Although the kit lense is good, I bought a 28-135 Canon zoom lense with image stabilizion and have produced stunning photo's with it. I love the way you can use the 7 points to focus, I mainly use only the center point with focus lock and never get an out of focus picture. I guess the nicest thing for me is that I now don't have the urge to buy every point and shoot camera that is paraded out on QVC or HSN that has a "wonderful" new feature like "low light or non-shake." This Canon has every good feature in the known universe and you can't outgrow it. Its a camera that will let you be as good as you can be, it won't hold you back. The battery life is great, the built in flash is good but I bought a 430EX and that's even better. I never figure I'm wasting money buying accessories for this camera as it will be my main squeeze for many years to come. I always missed my 35mm Canon slr's and now feel that I have an old friend back again, only much much better. Believe me, you can't go wrong getting this camera, its beyond description...

I love the new digital Canon. The only problem is it's not nearly as tough as it's film twin.  I had the camera less than a month when the pop-up flash quit working.  The Canon people have been great, and very helpful, but I'd rather not have had to send a brand new camera back to the factory.  The photos, however, are wonderful.  Film quality for the most part - printable and enlargable.  (It would probably be better to use the camera with a tripod when using the 300mm telephoto but I hike with it, so just remember to steady it before taking wildlife photos.

Now, this isn't the fastest card on the market.  But it is a solid, reliable card.  The camera itself is the bottle kneck, and typically not this card.  However, if you are using a Canon DSLR of a recent flavor, I would check if it needs to be RMA'd.  A known quantity of these cards have proven to lose images.  scary.  However, I've not experienced the mysterious loss of images with my card or Rebel XT.  I've only ever pushed the cards speed limits with my PD70X, and definately not with my Rebel XT

This is a great camera.  Plenty of resolution. Excellent shot speed.  Sturdy frame.  The kit lense doesn't do the camera justice.  Buy the body separate and add a better lense.

On the bad side, I had a small glitch with the camera's firmware soon after purchase and had to return it for a fix.  It was two months before the camera was returned.  Sorry, Canon...  you lose a star for that

"Wow!" is all I can say to express my reaction after getting prints taken with my 17-40.  I've been using Nikon manual-focus Nikkors since 1988 and was always satisfied with the color and sharpness.  However, after using the Canon "L" series, I've sold a lot of my Nikkors.  The color, clarity, sharpness, and detail of the "L" lenses are amazing.  The prints have this 3-D effect (without having to use those silly red/blue glasses!) 8-)  Within 3 weeks of receiving my 17-40, I ordered the 70-200.  Those two lenses will replace my whole Nikkor collection.  Build is really good.  The "L" zooms are a little bulkier, but very managable.  The Nikkors are smaller, but very heavy.  But lense technology and coatings have improved so much in 20 years, I can see the difference.  I tested the lens by pointing it toward the sun.  The 17-40 surprising handles flare very well.  With the sun just outside the field of view, there was very little flare and loss of contrast.  I also make 12x18 prints, and this lens handles them easily.  The body is going to be the limiting factor (refering to digital bodies).
Warning: once you use "L" glass, you are going to be spoiled.  You may not settle for consumer lenses anymore, although some non-L lenses are quick good from what I read

Don't listen to the reviews that claim that this lens is not a good choice for cropped sensor cameras (IE the 20D, 30D, Rebels etc) the Canon L lens are the best and this particular lens is no exception. I have had the lens for less than 24 hours now and am in love with the sharpness and color already. 

Great lens, great color, so well built, super sharp, just watch out if this is your first L lens, you'll be hooked.

This is a lens you will have for many years, great investment

Hi have a Rebel Extreme, and needed to use the high-speed mode... but the flash couldn't even vaguely keep up.  I was taking pictures of dancers, so needed a flash system that could keep up.  The Speedlite really does this perfectly - I'm able to take a rapid-fire sequence of photos, and this flash system is there each time.  I don't know if it really helps when taking a single photo, but if you want a flash that can keep up, this one is great!  I like it so much, I'm planning on buying one or two more for my next shoot, to run in slave mode with this one.

I'm new to the digital SLR world. I had been using the built in flash on my Rebel XT. The built-in flash had done alright, but was nothing to write home about. Since I had spent most of my money on the camera, I needed a flash that was both affordable and would get the job done. This flash met both requirements. IF you are an advance user, you will want a higher end flash because the flash has limited adjuastable features. Yet, if you a newbie like me, this flash is GREAT! It has improved my picture quality dramaticly.

I bought this flash to use on my Canon Rebel XT. The first thing I noticed was that without even reading the instructions I was able to get much better results on pictures taken indoors. Being able to bounce the flash off the white ceilings provided much better color contrasts to the built in flash. Even when I set my camera to shoot quick pictures in succession the flash did not let me down. It did not need anytime to recharge at all.
I recently just came back from vacation and took a lot of outdoor evening shots. Most of the pictures came back with great results. The only dissappointment I have is that when taking shots from further distance than I normally would, the pictures came back darker than I would've liked. So, to compensate for this I adjusted the flash exposure on my camera and although it was an improvement it was a hassle taking several test shots before getting it right.
Another problem I have with the flash is the battery cover. It's flimsy and I find it awkward to open and close at times. I always feel like I'm gonna snap it off by accident.
Overall I am happy. It's a good flash for the price you pay. The battery life is good. I still haven't even had to recharge the batteries and I've almost taken 200 shots with it. My low light picture have improved dramatically by investing in an external flash. Anyone with a decent camera should never use the built in flash. The difference is night and day

The camera handles very well - it's light and drives my Zoom lens and 18-55mm lens beautifully. I get professional photographs and can use it all day without suffering from heavy weight, which it does not have. The view finder is excellent and the readout on the back of the camera is extremely helpful, showing photos as they are taken - with zoom on the back screen, which immediately gives me the idea of the photo I want to use in my books. I say this is an outstanding lens and camera.

This lens is outstanding. Speed and sharpness are top-notch. I use this lens for a wide array of situations and it has always delivered impressive results. Best lens in it's class at a reasonable price. It's well built, sturdy, and not so heavy so it's relatively easy to carry around. Canon really impressed me with this lens. I use it with my EOS system (traditional and digital cameras).

Had the 70-200 f/4 and loved it to pieces with a D60, and now with a 1D MKII, but sold the 4.0 in order to pay for a 35-350, which is my work horse. Due to the push and pull feature however, the 35-350 gets dusty quick in good ol' Montana land, so it has to go in for cleanings every once in a while, and the f/stop isn't always desirable for certain situations.  The 70-200 F/2.8 is amazing. The twist zoom is a little close to the camera, so it takes some twisting of the wrist to get it where you need it, and IMHO, is a bit too much of a turn to be from 70 to 200 in the time one might need for extreme sports. (Rodeo, NASCAR etc) The clarity of this piece of glass just blew me away. I did a comparison of images from my 70-200 F/4 when it was new, and the 2.8 is still visibly sharper. I put an expensive filter on it, as my equipment is asked a lot of in very harmful conditions, and I do notice the slightest big of distortion with a filter, even though it is a good B&amp;W..... so when I can, I shoot the lens with no filter if I require extreme detail. The 35-350L is nowhere near the quality of this little 2.8... if it weren't for the difference in distance, this lens would be my one and only. Oh, and I love the IS. As it is my first IS Lens, I treasure is, but know I will not buy another distance lens without it

I use this gem on my 20D along with my 24-105mm, and as far as I'm concerned it is one of the best optical lenses out there. My 24-105 isn't the ideal indoor/low light lens nor is it the ideal sports photography lens( although it is sharp, just not quite long enough) The 70-200 fills in that gap in my arsenal with IS to boot! The photos I've taken so far on the sidelines are all keepers. If you can afford it, do it, you won't regret i

I spent alot of time evaluating this product.  Finally after reading the reviews I dug deep and spent the extra dollars to get this lense.  It has been a wounderful addition to my Canon Reble.  It is a very high quality product that is easy to use and delivers beautiful shot every time.

From a pure image quality standpoint, this lens will not please the pixel peepers.  On the wide end of the zoom, which I personally use more often than the telephoto end, this lens is not very sharp, and it suffers from fairly bad distortion.  Worse than that, for me, are the chromatic abberations; this lens is quite prone to significant CA when shot at the wide end, which can look a lot worse than a little bit of distortion or softness.  Given the price of this lens, one should expect a higher level of optical performance.

The maximum aperture of this lens is not very large, being f/4 on the wide end, and f/5.6 on the telephoto end.  The image stabilization makes up for this some, as you can comfortably shoot at much slower shutter speeds than otherwise, but, let's be honest here; this lens is a poor performer if you want to shoot in low light with no tripod.  The small aperture makes for a dark viewfinder, which can be a very big problem if you are trying to compose a picture in the dark (using a tripod).

Yet, I still gave this very imperfect lens four stars, and this is not without reason.


First of all, the focal length range is quite handy.  It isn't a mega-zoom that does everything, however, it covers the most often used focal length ranges, and is an appropriate lens to use for the vast majority of situations.  The little bit of extra zoom on the telephoto end is handy on occasion, and it's also worth noting that the lens sharpens up quite a bit when you zoom in some - it might be soft on the wide end, but zoomed in, it's quite good.

I have printed as large as 20x30" using this lens on a Digital Rebel, and have no qualms with the results.  Yes, there are sharper lenses out there, but you are a lot more likely to see the difference in sharpness on your computer monitor than in a print.

This lens has ring USM, which enables it to focus very quietly, and very quickly, whereas the slightly cheaper (and F2.8) options from the 3rd parties have normal focusing motors that are slow and noisy by comparison.

If you want to use this lens indoors, you are best off getting a flash to go with it, such as a 430EX.  The lens is usable in fantastic indoor lighting, or during the day, but won't give you good results in low light with no flash.  


If you will be shooting in lower light situations (people in particular), Tamron and Sigma have some good options in the 17-50mm range with F2.8 apertures, and I would recommend those lenses over this one.  If you'd prefer the extra telephoto range, the image stabilization so you can shoot with smaller aperture in poorer lighting situations for greater depth of field (instead of needing to shoot a landscape at f/4, for instance, without image stabilization, you could use f/11 on this lens, and get a sharp picture with better depth of field.  This is even more useful in the close focus range - while this isn't a true macro lens, if you take closeup photos without a tripod, you will want to stop the lens down for greater depth of field, and the IS helps with that quite a bit.


Overall, I've been fairly pleased with the performance of this lens.  If you like to worry about splitting hairs, and zooming all the way in on pictures on your computer, this lens is likely to dissapoint you.  If, however, you are willing to sacrifice optical perfection to get a very well rounded, useful lens, then I'd recommend it, however, would also recommend that you consider the 3rd party options, as they are also great lenses, and do offer a somewhat better value

I purchased this tripod from 47th Street Photo through Amazon.com.  The tripod appeared to arrive in good shape, except that the operating instructions were not included.  I immediately emailed 47th Stree Photo at the customer service address printed on the flyer they included with my shipment.  I asked them if they would be able to send me a copy of the operating instructions.  They did not respond to my email, so a few days later I emailed them again.  Once again, no response.  I then emailed Amazon.com, and informed them of the missing instructions and the non-responses from 47th Street Photo.  No response from Amazon either!  As far as the tripod goes, it appears to be a very good value for the money.  I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars because, due to the missing operating instructions, I cannot be certain I have properly checked out all of its features.  However, I am certain that both 47th Street Photo and Amazon.com rate zero stars for customer service.  I will use neither one again

I needed this tripod to use with my 20X50 binoculars since the least movement with 20X magnification causes the subject to wind up outside the viewing field.

This tripod works well for that use.  It is sturdy, has lots of features and is reasonably priced.

However, if you wish to use the tripod for binoculars, a right angle adapter will be needed.  I found one on eBay for a few dollars.

I received the tripod ahead of the expected schedule. I've been looking at tripods in stores in and around the greater Boston area. 

You can't get a better tripod for the money. In fact, you can't get anything "decent" for under $40-50 and even then I'm not sure you will get something this good. 

I had it shipped to my job and a few guys in the office (which I didn't know) had purchased a tripod in the past and where really impressed when I told them I only paid $25 for it. 

Conclusion: is the tripod perfect, NO. The head looks a little like plastic. But it has nice rubber feet and rubber grip in addition to everything listed on the website. This tripod is perfect for the beginner to enthusiast photographer.

I am impressed with the quality of photos with this camera. Occaisionally when I turn it on the lense doiesn't slide out, which is a little disconcerting. However, if I tap it, or turn it off and turn it o n again, it comes out to the operational position. I enjoy using it, amd wouldn't hesitate to purchase another one

The Digital Rebel is the most amazing camera i've ever owned. My previous camera was a Canon A90 and I loved using all the features on it [great camera!]. I decided recently that maybe I should graduate to a SLR because I was starting to get more creative with my photography. I spent a great deal of time researching cameras and finally decided on the Digital Rebel. After a few months of owning it I still am amazed. The image quality is fantastic, it's quick and responsive, and every day using it I learn a little more. It's the perfect intro SLR camera for me because everything makes sense and it's easy to learn. I've gotten amazing shots that I could never dream of getting with a point and shoot. 

If you are finding yourself wanting a little more than a point and shoot, go for this camera, you wont be sorry.

I am 67 years old and started out in photography as a kid with a contact printer and a box camera. I have had all types of cameras over the years, mostly 35mm film Canon slr's. I too bought all sorts of these 5-7 MP point and shoot digital cameras before returning to my true love, SLR's. I have had my digital Canon Rebel XT about a month now and I can't keep my hands off of it. It lacks nothing. Although the kit lense is good, I bought a 28-135 Canon zoom lense with image stabilizion and have produced stunning photo's with it. I love the way you can use the 7 points to focus, I mainly use only the center point with focus lock and never get an out of focus picture. I guess the nicest thing for me is that I now don't have the urge to buy every point and shoot camera that is paraded out on QVC or HSN that has a "wonderful" new feature like "low light or non-shake." This Canon has every good feature in the known universe and you can't outgrow it. Its a camera that will let you be as good as you can be, it won't hold you back. The battery life is great, the built in flash is good but I bought a 430EX and that's even better. I never figure I'm wasting money buying accessories for this camera as it will be my main squeeze for many years to come. I always missed my 35mm Canon slr's and now feel that I have an old friend back again, only much much better. Believe me, you can't go wrong getting this camera, its beyond description...

If you're looking for a high-quality telephoto zoom lens that is fast enough to use indoors, you may have found what you're looking for.  The 70-200/2.8 lens produces beautiful results that are overall on par with the 135/2 prime lens (although not quite as sharp).

The main downside to this lens is that it's big and heavy.  I don't mind carrying it around my neck on the camera so much, but when you go to use if you have to put extra effort into keeping the lens from shaking in your hands due to the weight.  And it's not exactly the sort of lens that I would want to toss into my backpack, just due to the immense size.

If you don't mind spending an extra $500, consider also the 70-200/2.8 IS (image stabilization) version of this lens.  It weighs even more, but the built in IS unit should help compensate for shaky hands whilst using the lens

I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) 

The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. 

The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it.

In the never ending race for larger and larger megapixel counts, the D70s has fallen behind the pack.  (However, if that's the only measure by which you're judging a digital camera - you really should consider further research before plunking down several hundred dollars.)  Nevertheless, it's quite a good camera.  

What I like about it most:
- It looks and feels solid.  Some of the reviewers that pan this camera for feeling flimsy and plasticky are apparently still stuck in the realm of pro cameras that cost several thousand dollars.  It's not a bulletproof titanium box that you can back a Hummer over, but it certainly seems to outdo DSLRs in it's category.  
- Very good battery life.
- Backwards compatibility with decade's worth of Nikon SLR lenses.

My gripes:
- The latch that keeps the pop-up flash in place broke in less than a week.
- Inability to meter through older manual focus lenses.
- Lack of full functionality with flashes other than the SB-600 and SB-800.  
- Nikon's RAW software and control software aren't included with the camera, and are IMHO overpriced.  (...and on top of that, Nikon has split what used to be one overpriced software package into two overpriced software packages...)

What would improve this camera the most:
- ISO 100 and ISO 3200+ 
- Ability to store multiple custom white balance presets, and then pull them up on the fly.
- Replacing the "idiot modes" (i.e. "portrait", "landscape", etc.) with modes that you could customize

This is my first time to purchase a battery grip for a digital SLR camera and it was a good investment. I don't have to worry about running out of battery power and at the same time it works as a vertical grip for my camera. It also  looks nice on my Canon 30D camera, coupled with an "L" series zoom lens

I started with the battery grip initially wanting the double battery availability. Having used a 35mm with a hand strap and already realizing the value of the stability of such a strap, this was my second attraction for the purchase of the battery grip and last but not at all least, is the ability to use shoot from the grip itself, allowing full ease of rotation of the camera.  Though I have never used the battery magazine that allows for the use of AA batteries, having it offers a backup should the canon batteries need charging and I am in the heat of shooting. I always travel with my charge AND four AA batteries. I would recommend this grip as a standard accessory for the EOS-20D and EOS 30-D. One thought to consider once on the camera it increases the overall height creating challanges with some camera cases.

Over the years I have been using Quantum Turbo and later 2x2 units ( No Turbo SC yet) to power various Canon speed-lights from 540EZ to EX580. With some skepticism I picked this unit as a trial on one wedding assignment. Well, although Quantum units  still have a place in my kit to power Metz Unit, I love the convenience of CP-E3. One recommendation. Buy couple of extra battery inserts, if you do lot of fast shootings, and keep them loaded with good quality Duracell NIMH's

This is a great lens. I do not want to repeat all the good things other reviewers have written about this lens. It is not so heavy so I use tripod without using tripod collar (costs 119.99 in B &amp; H). This is the best value I have ever got for a lens. Now I can't wait to get 17-40mm f4L too. You can get a very nice bokeh when wide open at f4 and f5.6, of course depending on the how far the background is from the subject. 
People complain how ugly the hood looks but that is subjective. I like it because it works great and you can attach it in a reversed position on the lens so that it will fit in your camera bag. I think the fit and finish of the lens is beautiful

I owned this lens for about a year before upgrading to the image stabilized f/2.8 version.  Overall I was very happy with the f/4 lens and miss having it available because of the significantly lower weight.  Sharpness is amazing and comparable for both lenses, and the f/4 can provide plenty of background blur.  If you are shooting mostly outdoors I would recommend the f/4.

This was the best item I ever bought for my camera. I do a lot of walking with my camera, and thought I would use it as a walking stick, which I do, but the best part of this monopod is what I never thought would happen. My pictures are NEVER fuzzy! I can take low light photos and have they come out clear. I paid very little for this item and would never be caught without it and my camera. The three levers on the bottom allow for quick expansion at all different lengths. The carrying case allows for this item to be packed next to my camera without it getting scratched

Not knowing fully what I was getting into, on a whim I purchased this monopod hoping that is was a half-way decent product, I mean-it was so cheap.  I was pleasantly surprised to find how sturdy the unit was and that what I had was a very high quality monopod.  This was my second monopod and so I had another to compare it with (the other was bought on an auction website).  In comparison the Opteka was a far better monopod in height and robust thickness and I use it exclusively on my miniDV shoots

I have taught photography at the college level, shoot 4x5 view camera work on occasion, and am very demanding about image quality.   I am quite satisfied with the image quality from my Kodak P880, particularly after I installed the newest firmware upgrade available from Kodak.

I went through several 7MP to 8 MP cameras before finally getting the Kodak P880.  The P880 has better image quality than some high end Sonys and Olympus 7-8 MP cameras like the DSC-V3 or the SP350.  I tested the P880 against the even higher end 10.3 MP large sensor Sony R1 and the difference in image quality in a 13x19 print between the P880 and the R1 was barely perceptible after minor sharpening and noise reduction, which the P880 images accept particularly well.   The zoom lens has a very useful range and is generally pretty sharp throughout its range.   Balance, manual controls and features feel high end and adequate for most semi-professional needs.   The camera is a little slow processing and storing pictures in RAW format and exposure bracketing modes but that really doesn't bother me because I do mostly landscape and fine art photos.   RAW file format is directly supported by most versions of Adobe Photoshop and Photoshop Elements as well as most other RAW processing programs like Bibble Pro.  Unlike most sub-$500 cameras, the P880 uses regular screw in haze and polarizing filters, a real plus and it has a highly controllable hot shoe.   Manual focus is usable and manual exposure control works well.   The direct mechanical zoom is also nice.

Overall, the P880 is a digital camera that can either be a high end point and shoot SLR-styled camera or one that can be used as fully manually as the most classic 35 mm film SLR.   

Although not small enough to slip in a pocket, the size is still reasonable and light

The new Nikon EN-EL3e battery is a slight update for the Nikon EN-EL3 provided with earlier dSLR models such as the D70. It adds a contact that allows new cameras to determine how much charge is left in the battery. The battery is grey to distinguish it from the black EN-EL3.

The EN-EL3e is backwards compatible with the EN-EL3: you can put it in your D70 or D50. The reverse is not true.

The number of pictures that the battery gives you depends on a lot of factors, including shooting style, LCD usage, and of course, camera. (The 2.5" LCD on the D200 will use up the battery much quicker than the smaller D70.) It is sufficient for a day of shooting. Unless you are using a D200 in some professional capacity, in which case, you'll probably be investing in at least one backup battery

This is my first and very expensive entry into digit SLR photography.
I have used canon point and shoot digital camera previously.

I was avoiding DSLR's because I used to rarely use my EOS film SLR.
The convienience of a point and shoot from that experience was overwhelming.
Unfortunately so are it's limitations.

So back I came, and the only choice though expensive was the EOS 5d for it's full frame sensor! The pain was reduced by the double rebates.

Wow! This is a revelation! Beautifull images, lot of control.

I did notice that the AF was not as fast as my old Elan IIE.

I was also disappointed that for the price there was a lack of weather sealing. I am not happy with canon for this, but I really appreciate them for making a full frame sensor in a difficult marketable slot as far as their line up was concerned.

This camera also needs prime or L lenses, because the sensor will reveal the inadequacies of inferior lenses. This add's to the cost.

This is an exceptional photographic tool that I hope to use to improve my skill as I explore all it's capabilities

There's no question that paying $100 or more will get you a better monopod. But for $16 the Sima SMP-1 is a tremendous value. 

I have a Sony DSC-W5 digital camera and have done everything I can think of to reduce camera-shake in low-light photos. This monopod has been great for adding stability and making my photos less blurry. 

The key is that it is small enough and light enough that I can take it almost wherever I go. And because it's so small, I can bring it in to places that would frown upon a tripod. 

A monopod is not a total replacement for a tripod. But this monopod is now the only addition to my camera that I take on trips

I purchased this case for my Canon A530 camera. I find that it does a great job of being light,durable,and compact. It keeps the camera clean and scratch free. However I wish the case had a better carrying capacity. I would have liked a bit more space for spare batteries and chips. I use different ones for different pictures or video. Batteries do tend to give out after a long day shooting and convient extras would be handy.
 The case has beltloops but not a good shoulder strap for times when a belt is not worn. That can be a bit akward. Otherwise this case is a good protector of my camera and fits it well.

I've had this camera for three years.  I bought it new, when it was cutting edge and very expensive.  I put a 128MB CF card in it.

First, I have to say that I have NEVER had the slightest problem with this camera or the software.  I've probably taken upwards of 5000 pictures with it, it's been all over the country.  The software has been installed on Windows 95, 98, 2000 and XP and I haven't had any problems with it.  The camera is solid, performs well, takes good pictures, and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the LCD viewfinder. If battery life were that big a deal, one could purchase a second battery and rotate.

All that said, I am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera.  They are razor sharp, the color balance is perfect, and the focus is great.  When taking pictures of people, however, it shows EVERY flaw in the subject's skin.  Scratches, oil, freckles are magnified and come out looking horrific.  It requires extensive Photoshopping to fix the flaws.  Other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better.  

I will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture. By the time the shot's taken, something (especially a squirmy child or a sports play) has invariably moved and it's not the exact picture you wanted.

I'm going to buy a real Single-Lens Reflex (SLR) to take baby pictures, but I'll keep this as a travel camera

If you're a professional photographer, you can probably ignore this review. But then you probably won't be thinking about buying this lens anyway, as you'll be off to purchase a nice L series.

However, if - like me - you just happen to have a nice Canon Digital Rebel camera (or equivalent) and enjoy taking decent pictures, this lens will probably work out very well for you. I've taken well over 1000 pictures with it in a couple of weeks, and it has performed very much as expected. For the price, it's perfect for a go-everywhere lens.

A few main points. Okay, it's not the best image quality. Even on low/medium ISO it seems a little grainy and its not as sharp as some of the more expensive Canon lenses. It struggles indoors unless you have a good flash unit, but for well-lit outdoor shoots it's works  very well.

Of course, it would be nice to have a nice L series with IS, but if you can't afford that then this is a very good value lens. Not for the real professionals, but great if you don't take things too seriously and just want a bit more zoom - and, let's face it, who doesn't want a but more zoom

I purchased this lens for my Canon EOS 20D digital camera and so far I really like it.  It focuses fast and produces very sharp, clear images.  As with any longer lens you do have to be careful about camera shake; I've had a few images come out blurry but these are usually interior shots.  I really like the 28-200mm focal length range and find the lens to be very versatile for framing wide shots of buildings or landscapes to zoomed in shots for portraits or close detail shots.  The lens feels solid and appears to be well constructed, which is typical for Canon products.  For the price range, this is an excellent lens.  You can only do better by spending considerable more money on an IS lens

I bought this lens a little over a year ago for macro shooting.  I quickly found out, however, that to shoot Macro-only with this lens is a crime.  It is a very versitile lens.  Its fast f/2.8 aperture makes for good shooting in low light.  I pretty much use this outdoors as the 100mm with the 1.6x crop factor of my Rebel XT eliminates most indoor oppurtunities.

I frequently use this lens for family portraits, the resultant photo is so crisp and clear and the bokeh really helps add snap to the primary subject.

As others have stated, this is a heavy lens.  It doesn't have Image Stabilization (IS) so a tripod or monopod is a great accessory to get the best images.  I use a beefy monopod for my best shots, although I have a lot of handheld gems...

If you are tight for cash, this isn't the "one lens" that does it all.  If you are looking for a versitile lens that can do outstanding macros and portraits, THIS is that lens.

I wanted to get a macro lens and everyone told me this was the one to get... I'm so glad I did. With the smaller sensor on my 30D, the 100mm is more like 150mm or so, so it's a nice , wide-open telephoto/portrait lens as well. I've uploaded a few photos I've taken w/ this lens to show what it's capable of in macro and telephoto. I thought the 17mm-85mm IS USM lens that came e/ my camera was sharp - but compared to this lens, the kit lens might as well be from a DIY pinhole camera.

My less than perfect rating is that there is no image stabilization available for the macro lenses. When I'm trying to hone in on bees pollenating a flower, there is a lot of shake. I can't practically use a tripod when the insects are bouncing from bud to bud, so I have to take 100 shots to get one that's not shake blur - and I miss some really cool shots. 

In addition to the lack of image stabilization, I am frustrated w/ the sometimes unpredictable focusing that will happen as the lens is trying to decide whether it should be focusing at telephoto or macro. I wish there was a switch on the lens to make it macro only or telephoto only, so it wouldn't be bouncing from one focal length to the other all the time.

I've taken far more successful telephoto shots than macro. The telephoto focal length is a bit long (for those of us who cannot afford a full-frame sensor camera) for most casual photography. I recently used this lens to shoot some promo shots of some massage therapists in a small eatery. I practically had to set up in the restaurant's bathroom to get the photos I wanted, but opted for this lens because it's much faster (2.8) and I wanted to use natural light over flash.

The lens is long and heavy for its range. With the addition of the battery pack grip, this lens added on is very weighty, so I may not take it w/ me in my kit bag on every shoot. Once I add another short fixed focal length lens and a moderate telephoto to my kit, my guess is that this lens will be pulled out for only special occasions.

It's tack-sharp, but it can be frustrating at times

I read many reviews at fredmiranda.com before I purchased this lens and I was not dissapointed one bit. I was lucky enough to receive a very sharp copy of this lens on the first try. The macro shots were very sharp and contrasty. The center part is already reaching near maximum sharpness at F2.8  Anything beyond F4 is tack sharp. Be carefull with this lens though. The DOF at F2.8 is extremely narrow. Don't mistaken the out of focus shots for being unsharp. Focus properly and crank up the aperture and you'll get some very satisfying macro shots. The only thing I wish this lens had was image stabilizer. Canon, how about a 100mm macro with IS?

The Digital Rebel is the most amazing camera i've ever owned. My previous camera was a Canon A90 and I loved using all the features on it [great camera!]. I decided recently that maybe I should graduate to a SLR because I was starting to get more creative with my photography. I spent a great deal of time researching cameras and finally decided on the Digital Rebel. After a few months of owning it I still am amazed. The image quality is fantastic, it's quick and responsive, and every day using it I learn a little more. It's the perfect intro SLR camera for me because everything makes sense and it's easy to learn. I've gotten amazing shots that I could never dream of getting with a point and shoot. 

If you are finding yourself wanting a little more than a point and shoot, go for this camera, you wont be sorry.

I love the bag for all the reasons others did not like it.  The product is listed as a gadget bag and that is what it is good at.  The S2 IS is a large camera for a point and shoot and it fits in very few bags.  This bag fit the camera easily and had space for all types of extras including batteries, chargers and extra media cards.  There is also enough room for another small digital camera or a film point and shoot.  

The correct way to advertise this case would have been for up to two bodies or four small lens.  Given that limitation, this is a great bag.

The bag is very well made and holds my Canon Powershot S2 IS very securely.  I lay the camera on it's back and that means that even if I accidently power it on the lens opens harmlessly.  The material is great and the waist belt is very practical.  The strap is well padded and after a day of use I believe it is one of the most comfortable straps I have used.  

Buy this bag for the correct camera and you will be very happy with it.

Got the Lowero SlingShot 100 about 2 months ago, and it is really coming in handy.  In the main area, it holds my pentax digital slr with one lens mounted, 1 rather small lens and 1 decently big zoom lens (80-320mm), plus a Sigma EF-500 Super flash.  It's packed in there, and the flash just barely fits, but i don't need much more room.  The top compartment holds extra batteries, recharger, etc.  Really easy to access the main pocket when it is on my back...just by pulling the case to my front (no need to take it off my back).  Well made.  Zippers are strong so I don't have to worry about one loosening and my equipment falling out.  Perfect for the amateur to semi-pro photographer.

This is an excellent device. Quick respond with my D80.
I use it to take the family pictures that include me.
I just point and press this remote to activate the D80's timer and It works beautifully

This lens is amazing. Nothing escapes it. It's like a black hole. Clearly the best lens I have ever owned. It's like the lidless Eye of Sauron from the Lord of the Rings. It is heavy and requires rethinking how you hold the camera. It comes with a beautiful case, a hood, and a tripod mount on the lens. Believe me you will need it. I took a few photos of my son from 250 feet away and they look great. I will now get to work reading the small manual. It has 2 focal settings and 2 stabilizing settings. Wow!

This thing is perfect for carrying your stuff around in a not-so-fattening way.  I hvae an external flash, macro kit, 28-80 lens, 50mm lens, 18-55mm lens, DSLR w/batt grip and 75-300mm lens ATTACHED all fit into the main body of this thing.  Everything is seperated by the dividers making me feel confident and safe while walking, hiking, biking, etc.  The addon pouches seem to make it a bit more bulking that you'd want, but the bag all by itself is fantastic and I can't recommend it enough - get away from huge bulky shoulder bags!!  Lowepro did it again

After using both lenses I think this is much better. Here are my reasons:

1- f 2.8 makes the autofocus much faster and accurate.
2- Bokeh is much better in this one.
3- Macro is slightly better on this one.
4- 105 mm does make a very little difference in image size.
5- IS is not very crucial in 24-50 range.

I think it very well could be so I'm not going to differ with those who say it is.I bought this to use with a new 5D and itt's simply outstanding in every regard. So far, I've kept it on the 5D and can't bring myself to take it off. 

I considered a couple of lenses, including the IS 24-105 f/4 which has a lot of appeal and the price is about the same. But this was the lens I chose in part because I already have a the 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6 DO IS Lens and the overlap seemed a waste while the extra stop helps.  I have no regrets about it. sharp as a tack and quick. 

I note that this is not compact lens, especially with the hood on and it can stretch out a lot when you widen the field. It is also not light. This lens and the 5D will give your neck and back a pain, assuming you work with more than one camera. But the focal lengths covered are just about ideal and require none of the compromises that a longer zoom range require. For that, I've got an 18-200 on a 20D. The 70-300 DO, while not an L, specs out in that range and has the virtue of real compactness, but it' not a lightweight. These two lenses cover just about everything for me. And I can keep the 10-22mm on the 20D for the extra-wide shots.

Since writing the initial review, I've since traveled for several weeks with this lens and it fully lived up to expectations. Given the difficulties of travel these days, I am concerned about the problem of not being able to carry it with me -- not a problem to date except for Britain. But always possible. And, despite the weight, I might favor the 70-200 F/2.8L IS USM as a second travel lens- I like the brightness of the focus.

One suggestion. There's a temptation to use this lens wide open a lot of the time. It's very good and sometimes that's the best thing. But I've also found this lens makes beautiful images stopped down a good deal for short night time exposures on a tripod and a remote release. The effect with lights, etc. is considerably different along with the extended depth of field.

If you are shooting with a compact chip camera like the 20D or rebel xt, you will be happier with the 8mm fisheye.  This 15mm fisheye will just be a really distorted wide angle lens due to the 1.6 factor.  If you love the fish eye style and have that camera, you'll need something WIDER to compensate for your smaller chip.

I was disapointed with this lens for that reason.  The Sigma 8mm is great.  A note to the reviewer below.  Sigma makes some good lenses and bad ones.  This is a good one and you probably got a bad copy.  It happens often enough with sigma gear.  With this lens, its good to go and try one at your local camera shop and make sure it has the style you want.  Bring YOUR camera with a chip in it and take a few shots and go home to check them out.  Decide if you like the style and if that piece of glass is a good copy.

I got a good copy and was still disapointed because of my lack of knowledge.  Sounds like you got a bad one

15 years of photography experience here... The Sigma 15mm fisheye has been extensively reviewed and compared by other websites (go ahead and search) and this is a very good product. The canon has a tighter focus and a *touch* faster in focusing, but with the massive depth of field with this lens, it's not a problem at all. 

Be aware that if you use this on a 1.6 crop factor digital SLR that has APS sensors like my 20D or digital rebel, then the fisheye effect is not as pronounced on film or 1.3 or full frame digital SLRs. 

Watch lens flare should direct sunlight hit it also...but that happens to any lens that has protruding or bulbous lenses. 

This is a much better bang for the buck lens than the canon equivalent which costs significantly more. If you search around, you can find much lower prices on this lens

This lens pouch is very durable and is of a good quality. It compacts down and does not have unneccesary bulk. Might seem alittle pricey but is worth it in the long haul.

I am not much of a photographer. I found this camera easy to use and my pix are just great. Believe me, it's the camera.  The stabilizer thing works to give clear focus almost every time. I can even put the pix up on the computer and send them easily.  I'm thrilled. You do need to upgrade to a 1 mgb. memory card when you buy the camera.

It is a great compact camera with a good zoom.  I can now leave a larger lens on my Nikon DX 70 and use this for closer shots.  YOu do need to try different settings to make sure you get the color you want. I really like it for most general quick shots, carry it wth me most of the time

<review_text>
This camera has been called a "pro-sumer" model and you should really take that title seriously. The quality of the pictures that it takes are just as good as a professional digital camera of the same resolution. The trade off is that it is really not happy being thrown in a bag (or big pocket, if it fits). Why? Because Canon have given it a really annoying power-on switch that is guaranteed to turn the camera on 90% of the time when you're moving it to or from a bag. To compound this problem, the lens extends (in your bag), pushing off the lens cap and leaving it open for possible damage. So, if you think of this as a professional camera, to be kept in a real camera-case, you'll probably be okay. If you're somebody, like me, who likes to throw his camera in a bag or pocket, you're going to be annoyed by the power switch. That said, I do LOVE the quality of the pictures and all control that the camera gives you over every aspect of taking them.

CONS: stupid power-on switch that always catches and turns camera on; lens cap is kind of loose and falls off easily; widest angle is maybe a little too telephoto still (around 35mm?)

PROS: awesome pictures; tons of controls all over the outside of the camera allowing you to control a lot without having to resort to menus; professional features including flash hot-shoe and replaceable lens; great battery life; awesome picture

I bought this filter for my 28-135 IS canon lens and so far it has worked out great.  Unlike some of the other tiffen filters I bought, this one fits just right on the lens.  All sides are even and it sits flush against the lens.  I haven't noticed any artifacts from pictures I've taken yet, but I haven't really had much of a chance to take many pictures with the lens.  The night shots I've take so far, I've been quite pleased with, however

i have another camera w/ 12x optical &amp; tons of features but i wanted something compact &amp; ready to take quick snaps. this fits the bill. on my recent vacation i was impressed with how quickly it booted up and focused in to get those unplanned shots. the x-large screen makes it really easy to see if you got a good one and the image stabilisation seems to work better than on my previous camera (canon A80)...either that or my hand is steadier. last but not least - the battery life was impeccable. I took a nearly 200 photos, plus spent a lot of time reviewing and showing off pics to friends with no need to recharge. the battery is a 'custom' one which concerned me but the charger is VERY compact and travels well. it has integrated prongs that fold flat when not in use - no cables :)

I absolutely love this camera. I've told everyone I know to buy it. The picture quality is amazing. There are so many options with this tiny little camera! You can edit pictures before you even print them. Zoom in on a picture already taken and save it that way, and so much more. I take pictures of everything! 

I charged the battery when I got the camera, which was about three weeks ago, and it's still going. I have 7/8th of battery life left. I haven't had to charge it again. 

I am so happy with my purchase! I hope this helps you

I wanted to buy a compact slim d-camera. Those with larger zoom are quite bulky, you can't carry around all the time. I think a slim camera is a better choice. I slip into my pocket while wondering around and come across something nice and take a picture of it. You can't do it with a huge camera. 
After I made up mind about a slim camera, my choices were either Casio Exilim or Sony DSCW series. Casio Exilims are very sexy. They have a lot of mode scenes. They also function as voice recorder. You can take pictures of book pages etc. They have anti-shake capability which is said to reduce blurred images. I was almost buying a Casio Exilim. Being a diligent person I wanted to search more and more. 
I found out that the so-called anti-shake feature is a bogus. Many people found it useless. That was a good reason to choose Casio. Then I found the picture quality of Exilim is not really good.I found some pictures taken with Exilim. They were soft, not crisp colors. Search the web reviews made by photo professionals. Casio Exilim is rated significantly less than Sony in picture quality. With ISO 200 noise was still detectable in most reviews . Those same reviewers however found Sony DSCW doing a better job . There was no noise with ISO 400 which means even in lower light condition Sony did a better job (less granularity in pictures with low light). Big difference!.
One feature of Sony that made it very attractive was its strong macro. It is 0.74 inch which means you can bring your camera 0.74 inch (2 mm) close to an object (say a bug) and still take a brilliant picture of it. 
Now comparison of Exilim and Sony to summarize:
Casio Exilim
Anti-shake (it's a bogus)
Slim   
Lower macro (2.5 inches)
Lower picture quality (detectable noise at ISO 200)
A lot of scene modes
Quick shutter
Sony DSCW Series
Slim (in fact it is slimmer)
Higher macro (0.74 inches)
Higher picture quality (No noise in ISO 400)
Not a lot of scene modes
Quick shutter
So.....I purchased a Sony DSCW 7 Mp. I took lots of pictures.
They are all brilliant, detailed and crisp, true colors.
I tried macro and took pictures of bugs. You can see the hairs on the legs of bugs. Absolutely no noise whatsoever, no blurry.
It's a marvel of technology. I took pictures of fireworks in July 4th using high ISO setting. They came out brialliantly like professional pictures.
It also uses a different kind of battery that you can't buy at your grocery which can leave you vulnerable. So you may wanna buy a spare one (about 40 bucks). But you can always recharge it. And it lasts much much longer than AAA or Nimh batteries. 
It was a perfect choice. I highly recommend it.

I just got this camera a month ago and I am satisfied with it. It has a lot of features despite its size. And for point and shoot I can say it's a great buy, comparable to other power packed cameras, it even takes better pictures sometimes.

But I just had to give it a 4 because I thought I could do more with it. But you can't do much with the settings since it has it's own default settings for certain conditions. But over all it's a great camera. If you're just after taking normal pictures and you want something sleek, this is definitely a good buy.

Yes it is a very fine lens. IS and 105 mm long end are also appealing but after buying this I decided to sell it in favour of my EF 24-70 2.8L after 2 weeks of usage.

f4 makes clearly the autofocus slower and fuzzier. Bokeh is also worse than the other one. 
the viewfinder gets darker in 1.6 crop bodies. 
105 mm does make a very little difference in image size. 
Plus the macro option is weaker on this one.

If you don't care about the weight go with the EF 24-70 2.8L imho.

I own several Canon lens for my 20D and this is hands down the best.  I had a 28-135 which was a very good lens regardless of some reviews, and I got many excellent photos with it - this is distinctly better in all ways.  (Of course, it costs a lot more).  Recently went with the grandchildred to Sea World and I got 100% good photos, with several really outstanding ones.  It is light, accurate and has IS - what more do you want?  You can replace a slew of lens with this one and perhaps selling the old ones will help pay for it.  Bought it as soon as it was available and have not regretted it one moment.  If you have one lens, this is the one

I've had this lens for 2 months now, and love it. It was my first "L" lens and I can see the quality difference in this line. First, I tried the 28-135 IS-pretty good. But I wasn't totally happy, so returned it and ordered the 24-105 L. Now I'm happy. Contrast, sharpness, &amp; CA are much better. Build quality &amp; feel are superior as well. Plus the IS really works. I will try &amp; get all IS lens in the future, I believe it is worth the extra cost. Focusing is very quick and zoom action is smooth &amp; steady. If you're on a budget, the 28-135 is real nice. But to go all the way, I recommend this lens. The IS on the 24-105 L is quieter I found. The price is a bit steep, but optical quality is there, resale value will remain good, and weather sealing should hopefully keep dust and junk from getting inside this lens.

     Despite reading glowing reviews about this lens, I was still surprised to see how well it performed.  The lens is SO sharp you can get very good cropped pictures of running athletes, from a distance of three quarters of a Football field away, shooting hand held, with late afternoon light, which will print a 5x7 and still look like a Pro took them!
If you want a tack sharp lens for indoor sports pictures and can't afford, or otherwise do not want another long lens for outdoor sports pictures, then you should give this lens your serious consideration.

 At a recent NYE event, I shot a lot of photos in a concert setting without a flash and am very impressed with the sharpness &amp; clarity of this lens performance. Its so fast and the colors are vibrant. I am not a seasoned pro but with the 20D and this lens, it makes me look pretty close. I did shoot in manual and once I got my aperture &amp; shutter speed dialed in, it pumped out a lot of great pics.
 I have also shot some pics of waterfalls (slowing down my shutter speed to get that soft flowing image) and portraits of people and again, it oozed excellence. The 135mm focal range is not as convenient as a zoom, but the quality of this prime lens makes up for any incovenience

For the price and quality I rated this lenses with 5 stars.
If you really want to see how good this lens are see the photos I took in Europe.  I too around 5000 photos. I posted a few on the web (See link below).

For the price I recommend this lens as walk around lens. The zoom is pretty usefull They are very realiable and (almost) very sharp. Get this lens instead of the kit lens (18-55 mm) until you are ready to spend more.

Here are some of my pictures taken in Europe with this lens (Images have been compressed):

Every picture of mine that included larger portions of the sky would have these stubborn spores on it. Pretty infuriating, especially when you got the shot just like you wanted it. Yes, you can always remove those on Photoshop (or cheaper yet, The Gimp); but isn't it cool when you look at a picture and say: "that is it, nothing to do on it!" ??

And it wasn't just the sky. Any off-white but light plain colored background would suffer visibly from the acursed specks.

With this blower, greatly priced (pity that Adorama doesn't have free shipping though), I put my camera on the tripod, pointed it down, squirted three or four times - and gone are the specs!!!

Great buy for DSLR owners

I use this little gadget mainly for macro and portrait work.  When you have it on the light emitting from the flash is diffused which gives you a more flattering less contrasty light to illuminate your subjects with.  Unless you are going for a very shadowy, high-contrast, image this diffuser can save the day.  It is very light weight and easy to pack in small places, so you should never have a good reason to leave it behind.  Sometimes it is the simple things that make the biggest difference in a photo, and using this can defiantly make very noticeable differences

This seemingly simple piece of molded plastic was recommended to me by a professional photographer.  Basically it's the shape of an open box that slides firmly onto the flash.  It is small and sturdy enough to stash in your camera bag without worrying about damage.  When used the light disperses more evenly and is less harsh on the subject being photographed.

The white box is for general use.  Also available are the green Omni-bounce for florescent lighting and the gold Omni-bounce for a warming effect.

PROS:
Inexpensive solution for better flash photography.
A quality product that works.

CONS:
Non

After checking prices with all the usual pricing bots, I found a better price, including free shipping, by going directly to Amazon. This lowest price did not appear in the other searches, so it pays to go to Amazon first.

I replaced my Canon SD400 with the Casio and find the controls more logical to use. This is important if you don't use the camera for a while, because you can just pick it up and start shooting without hunting for the manual. Also, the docking base is much more convenient than plugging small cables into the camera. You do not have to remove the battery in the Casio to charge it as you do with the Canon SD400. The VGA movie quality is superior on the Casio. Still pictures appear to be about equal. 

Amazon delivered by UPS in record time even with a weekend inbetween. I ordered on a Friday and received it the following Tuesday. Go with Amazon!

This was one of the first lenses that I purchased with my Rebel XT.  Now after taking several thousand pictures with it I can honestly say it was well worth the cost.  I very rarely have any unsharp pictures with this lens unless it is my own fault by trying to use too slow of a shutter speed without a tripod.

I also have the 180mm f/3.5L Macro Lens, which costs about 3 times more than this lens, and although it is very clear and the extra reach is nice at times especially since it can be used with both the 1.4X and 2X TC's, it is very difficult to use inside without a tripod.  The 60mm can be handheld if needed with very good results even if you have to bump your ISO up a little to do so.

I have also used this lens for both inside and outside portrait work with very nice results.

All-in-all, given it's small size and light weight I very rarely leave this lens behind when I go out because you never know when you might see a great macro shot

This replacement battery is half the cost of Canon's yet offers longer life.  I bought it when I first got my SD10.  When one battery runs out, the spare goes in.  The Lenmar still works great while the Canon is near end life!  I am buying two more since they are so cheap!

DO NOT buy no name batteries on ebay.  They do not last worth a darn and are basically a waste of money!  Don't do it..

This camera meets or exceeded everything I expected from it. Very easy to learn, read the manual and use the web site tuturial and when the battery is charged your ready to go take pictures. I highly recommend this camera

I recently moved into the prosumer level of digital.  The Canon D30 has proven to be an awesome camera.  There maybe better (D60), but if you are serious about digital, the D30 has to be one of the best cameras for the price.  There is a slight lag between shots, but if you are not photographing speeding bullets and express trains, the time between shots is hardly a distraction

I took this with me recently to Australia and shot landscapes as well as others, and the pictures came out better than the film cameras I have used recently, plus you don't need a scanner.  This camera works great, a must have for semi-pros.  Pros, wait for the new 1D.  Pictures come out great at 11&amp;quot;x17&amp;quot;

This camera is amazing. Out of the 3 digital camera's under $150 I've used, this is by far the best, beating out the Kodak and the SiPix. I originally bought the SiPix, and it was junk. Don't buy the SiPix that's under $150. The Kodak for some reason didn't seem like it took as good pictures as the FinePix, but the software was a little better, being from Kodak. 

This camera can take pictures of resolution up to 2 megapixels, but I don't even use that option because the 1 megapixel pictures are so amazing. It comes with a 16MB removable memory card, so you can take around 49 pics at 1MP, around 24 at 2MP, and it takes short videos for about 30 seconds in mpeg format at a 320 x 160 resolution, or more on a lower setting. The LCD screen can easily be turned on or off to save battery power, and the 2 AA batteries it takes lasts pretty long. It has a nice, sleak design, and the software has no issues with windows XP at least. 

The only cons I could think of are that the only zoom it has is 2X digital zoom, which is pretty much useless, and I never use it, since it's the same thing as zooming in with your picture viewer on your computer. So you can consider it not having any zoom. The software for it works well, but it could be better, options wise. The filenames of the pictures will default to a number depending on its order on the memory card, so if you transfer pics to your computer more than once in a day (since it creates folders based on date), you'll have to rename each pic. But I hardly complain, since the pictures come out so incredibly well. 

I'm so happy with this camera! If you want a camera under $150, this is the one to get. Don't even waste your time with the Kodak, unless you want the one with 3X optical zoom, but that's $200. I use it for general purpose, taking pictures of freinds and such. Once in a while I take a picture of a sunset at 2MP, and that will be photo quality printed on a full page. 1MP creates crisp and clear desktop wallpaper size images, and .3MP will created good smaller images to put on websites. There's no reason to buy anything else, go with the Fuji FinePix A200!

First thing to do is to make sure which lens you are buying. The kit lens comes with Canon 20D, 30D, 300D, or XT is the lower version, non USM one. On the higher version USM ones, you will see the red color "USM" at the front of the lens.  

According to the reviews, compare with the non USM ones, optically they are the same. However, the USM motor does focus faster and much quieter. 

People complain about the build quality. Actually I feel that it is really not that bad, much better than the Canon 50mm f1.8 II. The USM auto focus performance is fast, never hunt, and much quieter than the 50mm f1.8 II. It fits nicely on the XT.

Do not compare this hundred dollar lens to other lenses cost three times or more. We have to compare apple to apple. If you know the limitations on this lens and use it wisely, the images will come out nicely. 

1. This is not the lens for indoors low light conditions. If you need to take lots of indoor pictures and the flash is not allowed, go get a different lens. (For example, I use a Canon 50mm f1.4 for this kind of situation.)

2. The distortion on 18mm is quite a bit. Avoid taking strait lines (like buildings) pictures on the edge while wide open. However, this can be easily corrected on computers.

3. Step down the aperture to F8 or F11, the resolution will be improved a lot even at the corners. 

Overall, the performance is very good for a hundred dollar lens. It is very light weight and highly portable while traveling. This fits my needs as a cheap but fast with good image quality walk around lens.

Let's be honest...  a "kit lens" that adds approximately $70 to the overall price of a camera body is not supposed to be Canon L-series quality.  Sure, you can find a better quality lens, but not for $70 you can't!

I plan to use this lens as a knock around lens that allows me to get more familiar with my camera and run off some shots.  Personally (and this is a personal preference), I find that I tend to want to be closer to subjects anyway - with the 1.6x factor on the Rebel XT, I'm in great shape with some of my other lenses.

If you don't happen to already have a super wide lens in your arsenal, and you are getting a digital EOS with the 1.6x magnification factor, then buy this lens.

Please don't let some of the other "lens snobs" sway you - a few of which are actually "posers" that snap less than 500 pix per year and spend more time looking at the technical aspects of the picture instead of its true artistic value.  I can hear them now.. "it isn't contrasty enough", "the barrel distortion is horrible at the wide end", "pin cushion is significant"...

I say BAH!!

Are these statements true... sure they are... to a degree.  But let's remember that not everyone can afford to be as picky.

Buy the lens, load the camera with a fresh battery and a blank memory card and GET OUT THERE!!  

If you find yourself shooting at the wide end often, THEN sell/give this lens to a colleague and go in search of another (higher quality) lens... very little lost.  

Enjoy yourselves and take lots of pictures...  good luck

I've had this camera for about 1 1/2 years now and it's been a tried and true companion.  I've easily taken over 10,000 shots with it and produced some really exceptional photographs.  The features that really set this camera apart are the 12X zoom, the image stabilization (a must with such a large zoom), and the rotating screen (great if you want to take a picture of yourself :)).  I also love the macro mode, I've gotten some great quality close-ups.  For most situations you can just stick it in auto mode and get great results, but the different scene modes are fun to play with as well.  Performs extremely well outdoors -- wildlife, sports, landscape, beach, etc. 

My only real complaint is its performance in low-light situations.  Pictures are grainy and the camera is very slow to respond, sometimes not responding at all.  Also it can eat through batteries fairly quickly -- regular AA batteries lasted me about 2.5 hours of continuous shooting (around 200 pictures) or less if I was shooting in cold weather.  I would definately recommend rechargable batteries.

Overall I've really enjoyed this camera.  I've used and abused it and apart from low-light situations (which I was rarely in anyway) it never let me down.  Both my grandmother and my great aunt bought one within the past 6 months and they rave about it

I had viewed concert photos taken with the S2 from a number of different photographers and they absolutely took my breath away. Saw the output of other cameras in comparison and they didn't even come close.

I was using the Canon A80 prior and while I was happy with it, my first round of photos with the S2 proved to be most impressive. While you can use this as a point and shoot, this is a camera that you should spend some time learning so that you can get the most from it. And although the S3 is the latest version of the camera, I'm not sure you get that much more for the money

I'm very pleased with this small unit that has a great deal of power. It's compact, not heavy, has an adjustable power output by simply spinning the wheel on the camera to the left or right. In addition to the light output, the head can be tilted so the light can be direct or bounced, an excellent feature. Getting up and running with this unit was a breeze because I am totally "brochure reading averse." 

Twenty years ago I was a photographer with big equipment, but had given up both.  I was surprised by the control one has with such a small and relatively inexpensive unit

An excellent flash to use with my Canon 20D at a fantastic price, the Canon 580ex was an expensive option, but should I buy one in the future ? the 430ex is perfect as a slave unit.

Just returned from a trip to Hawaii and had the opportunity to put this lens to the test.  I was very pleased with the results.  This is a powerful lens, yet it is relatively light weight and not burdensome to use.  I was able to get some really amazing wild life shots of birds, zooming in from a distance with a hand held camera (Canon EOS 20D) and virtually every shot was a keeper.  The IS feature allows you to quickly zoom and compose your shot and fire it off and the image quality is excellent with sharp focus.  Usually a lens this size with this much power requires a firm grip and almost always a tripod - not so with this one.   I shot in both portrait and landscape mode and I didn't see any problems with focus, clarity or sharpness.  All the images were clean and razor sharp.  If you are looking for a long lens with the ability to bring in a distant shot without having to use tripods and other equipment, I highly recommend this lens for your arsenal.

Have used this lens from the deer stand while hunting, at sporting events (indoor and outdoor) and at concerts.  Fast focusing and great image stabilization (IS does use quite a bit more power, though).  Have not had one problem with it. Solid build and has a little heft to it.  It is a bit pricey, but I chaulk that up to it being about the best on the market.  Would recommend it to anyone looking for a top shelf lens.

This camera is really great.  I knew I liked it before, but I immediately began to appreciate this camera all the more when I ended up with a Rebel XT as a "loaner" while my 20d was in repair.

Not that the XT is a bad camera, it just doesn't really compare to the 20d.

The 20d has a nice feel to it; it is fairly large, which is great since I have somewhat large hands.  The features are great too.  And the image quality is awesome.  I don't really need to go into all of the details, as most of the other reviewers have done an excellent job.  Let me just say that it is a great camera and is worth the five stars.

The only complaint I have about the camera is that it doesn't have spot metering.  The ability to do your light metering off of a single point of interest would be great - and they did add it to the 30d.

This is a great camera.  Plenty of resolution. Excellent shot speed.  Sturdy frame.  The kit lense doesn't do the camera justice.  Buy the body separate and add a better lense.

On the bad side, I had a small glitch with the camera's firmware soon after purchase and had to return it for a fix.  It was two months before the camera was returned.  Sorry, Canon...  you lose a star for that

I mainly bought this to go on the end of the lens adapter for the S2 IS.  It does well to protect the lens, but you can't put a lens cap over it.  It ends up being easier to use without the lens cap...and quicker when taking pictures.

The pictures are very good through it

I have used this lens for over 6 months now and have over 1k shots through it.  It is as fantastic as others note herein.  The 2.8 through the focus range is really great.  Superb.  The VR function is really a neat trick.  It is super fun to play with.

The drawbacks are size and weight.  After a 1/2 hour of shooting, your arms will get tired.  Remember to be careful and hold the lens and not the camera.  This lens is definately heavy enough to bend/warp the camera body

This lens has only two "faults."  First, it is big and heavy--quality construction often yields a heavy lens.  Second, once the photographer has seen the results that this lens can produce, there is a likelihood that he or she will be unhappy with the other lenses in the camera bag.

Results first: the images are razor sharp with this zoom mounted on my Nikon D70s.  I can get shots that I never could get before because this lens is so crisp that subjects taken at a distance nevertheless can be cropped to produce an acceptable close-up image. Subjects taken at more normal distances are breathtakingly sharp--as if shot with an excellent prime lens. This is a fast lens (F/2.8 throughout its entire zoom range).  Almost more importantly, this lens has the best "Bokeh" that I have ever experienced in a lens.  "Bokeh," to the extent that I understand the concept (it is a Japanese word meaning roughly "unfocused"), is a word describing whether the out-of-focus portion of an image (i.e. a blurred background in a photo in which only the subject is in focus) has a pleasing look to it.  This lens produces wonderful, creamy Bokeh.  The sharpness and Bokeh, combined with the excellent bright color rendition of this lens, makes this one a true classic.

I have occasionally experienced minor ghosting on this lens when shooting into a very bright subject, i.e. the sun reflecting off of the ocean.  This is a normal shortfall of a zoom lens comprised of a multitude of elements, and I have sometimes experienced this.  But such occasions are rare.

The autofocusing action of this lens is very good.  Even birds at very long distances usually produce a quick, snappy autofocus lock on my Nikon D70s.  Very seldom does it "hunt" for an AF lock, and these occasions are likely due to operator error rather than the lens.  This lens also features Vibration Reduction (VR) which enables it to produce acceptable images below what an F/2.8 lens would otherwise be suitable for.  The VR really works, too, although it is by no means a panacea for dim lighting.  

This is one of Nikon's professional lenses, and the quality of construction is excellent.  The critical mount is metal, and the entire lens is built like a tank.  The lens comes with a nice squeeze-style lens cap, and a very good lens hood that can be easily reversed for storage.

The reader can see that I am extremely enamored with this lens.  The reason is that, notwithstanding its bulk and weight, this lens produces the best nature shots that I have ever managed to take, by far.

I'm surprised to see that a lot of people only give 1* to this camera! I've had it for 2 years now and i just love it! Thanks to it, I discovered I had a real passion for photography... It's very easy to use and my pictures are great! When I show them, people usually tell me " you must have an expensive camera"... and i just show them my little Canon S500 and they are surprised with the result!
I'm just loving it

I love this flash.  I just recently purchased it and have used it for 2 big events and it worked perfectly.  I still don't know everything that it is capable of doing but am still able to work it just fine without even reading the manual.
I would definitely recommend this flash.

This camera is simply amazing!  I started out with a Canon G2, and then a Canon G6, and then a Canon 20D, and now this Canon 1D Mark II N.  I debated and researched for 3 months between the 1DS Mark II, 5D, and 30D.  My decision was primarily narrowed down to the 5D and this 1D Mark II N.  Yes, I wish this camera was a full-frame and also shared the 12.8 MP like the 5D, but you know what?  It practically killed me trying to weigh the pros and cons and finally I made my decision to go with this one and I'm 110% glad that I did.  

For me, this camera is definitely THE ONE to get because the 45 point Focusing, 8.5 fps, and the 1D Pro Body/Interface/Menu/Layout, etc is what really makes this camera worth it and the deciding factor.  Trust me, if you don't know how seriously fast the 8.5 fps really is, you need to go out to your camera store and try it out before you decide.  Because of this 8.5fps alone, I'm actually able to capture a lot of shots that I normally get lucky getting with my 20D.  And with a 5D at 3fps, I just said forget it...No way.  I'm not even a professional taking pictures for a living.  This is just purely a fun hobby for me and stepping up from a 20D to this camera is out of this world.  With the phenomenal auto focusing, additional metering, it's like I'm now playing with a Bentley (with the 1D MK2 N) coming from a Mercedes C230 Hatchback (The cheapest Mercedes that people buy just because it's a Mercedes name and they don't want to spend any more money on a real Mercedes).  This camera and the photos truly almost help me take pictures like a pro.  

Also, I don't shoot action pictures all the time, and I do love portrait photography, and landscapes and printing and blowing up large sized pictures.  But even with the 1.3 crop factor, there is still a HUGE improved difference going from a 1.6 crop and you won't have vignetting problems with some lenses that you'll have on a 5D.  With this 1D MK2 N, you can still take wonderful wedding photography, landscapes, etc.  As much as I'd like to have 12.8MP like the 5D, 8MP is really all that we need these days unless you're going to blow up and print photos that are larger than 8X10's or around there.  Unless you're printing extremely large posters and whatnot, you can pretty much do everything with this camera that the 5D can.  The resolution and MP is definitely enough.  Plus, it's also invaluable to know that you have the 8.5 fps available and ready to use if you need to and you can also tone it down and use a slower fps if you need to.  The extra bonuses with this camera which I look at as a secondary positive, are the weather seals, pro-build high quality construction body, easy to use and navigate menu system, you can see the iso information in the viewfinder as well as the lcd screen at all times, dual memory card capability, you can shoot on 2 memory cards at the same time as one for backup or use 2 separate cards independently, built-in battery grip (you don't have to shell out extra for this), longer battery life than the other cameras, best customization and most options that you can set to your liking, more than the 5D or the 20D or 30D.  I could go on and on but definitely get this camera if you can afford it.  Otherwise, the 5D is also a great choice too if you need to save the money, and all you do is take landscape pictures all day long, or never will have a use for fast action or have a need to capture quick moments, and don't want the fast and most accurate focusing system that's great for ai servo.

I had a chance to compare it with a Tokina glass. Canon is better on a contrast and better on a distortion, same or even slightly worse on a sharpness, and complete looser on a build quality.
If you are ok with 12mm - get Tokina

Up Front: If you're considering this lens, stop considering  - and buy it. I had occasion to try the Tamaron Zoom in this range and noticed plastic-y digital qualities in some of the Tamaron's highlighted-texture areas. None of that is a problem with this Canon beauty. I am using it as my normal lens. The contrast is razor-sharp enough to shave with. It's graphic in monochrome and colors are pure and leap off the monitor like a politician attracted by a TV camera. It's also light weight and plenty fast enough with practically no spherical Abs....

Tiny problems include an understandable perspective bulging on subjects about the edges. And there is some blue fringing on very high contrast edges. Photoshop nails the latter dead'er than Britney Spears' career. I've had a need for reasonably large blow-ups, with most captures cropped, yet still enlarged up to prints that are minimally 13X20. At that size not only does this lens reproduce a subject's pores, but you can peer down and see the stuff inside the craters.

In the never ending race for larger and larger megapixel counts, the D70s has fallen behind the pack.  (However, if that's the only measure by which you're judging a digital camera - you really should consider further research before plunking down several hundred dollars.)  Nevertheless, it's quite a good camera.  

What I like about it most:
- It looks and feels solid.  Some of the reviewers that pan this camera for feeling flimsy and plasticky are apparently still stuck in the realm of pro cameras that cost several thousand dollars.  It's not a bulletproof titanium box that you can back a Hummer over, but it certainly seems to outdo DSLRs in it's category.  
- Very good battery life.
- Backwards compatibility with decade's worth of Nikon SLR lenses.

My gripes:
- The latch that keeps the pop-up flash in place broke in less than a week.
- Inability to meter through older manual focus lenses.
- Lack of full functionality with flashes other than the SB-600 and SB-800.  
- Nikon's RAW software and control software aren't included with the camera, and are IMHO overpriced.  (...and on top of that, Nikon has split what used to be one overpriced software package into two overpriced software packages...)

What would improve this camera the most:
- ISO 100 and ISO 3200+ 
- Ability to store multiple custom white balance presets, and then pull them up on the fly.
- Replacing the "idiot modes" (i.e. "portrait", "landscape", etc.) with modes that you could customize

I am a professional photographer, and I have owned this camera for nearly two years.  I also have a D70 for backup.  The batteries go forever, it is very quick to respond, the images are beautiful, and it has the typical Nikon durability and reliability.  If you are already a Nikon user, the controls will fall easily to hand.

That having been said, the computer software with this camera is a joke.  For the best image quality shoot RAW files, color balance with a grey card, and render the images with software like Capture One LE.  The uselessness of the included software is the only reason that this camera gets four instead of five stars.  Come on, Nikon, be real!!!

Shortly after I got my first D70, I shot a model for a small photo for a side bar in a catalog.  I got an ugly feeling in my gut when I was told that the designer had taken a shot that was 3/4 figure, cropped to the head and shoulders, and enlarged the image for the cover of the 8.5 x 11 in catalog.  By the time I found out, it was already at the printer.  As it turned out, I was pleasantly surprised: the cover shot looked great.  After that incident, I have trusted this camera and have always been pleased with the results.

This camera is better than 35 mm in every way except response to the shutter button.  In resolution and color reproduction it is more comparable to a medium format film camera.  It is imperative to shoot RAW and process the files properly to get the most out of this camera.

I can't wait to try the D80

Excellent camera kit. Versatile. I have a lot to learn about the camera, though, as it is no simple point-and-shoot. However, in Auto mode, it takes great point-and-shoot pictures. I look forward to learning how to use it fully. Lenses came with warranty cards, but the camera itself did not. I bought the SB-600 flash as well and another battery and two 1 GB compact flash cards to round out the kit. Camera with lens attached is large, which I underestimated. $80 camera bag is too small for it all. Great camera, though. Price was the best I could find anywhere

The Digital Rebel is the most amazing camera i've ever owned. My previous camera was a Canon A90 and I loved using all the features on it [great camera!]. I decided recently that maybe I should graduate to a SLR because I was starting to get more creative with my photography. I spent a great deal of time researching cameras and finally decided on the Digital Rebel. After a few months of owning it I still am amazed. The image quality is fantastic, it's quick and responsive, and every day using it I learn a little more. It's the perfect intro SLR camera for me because everything makes sense and it's easy to learn. I've gotten amazing shots that I could never dream of getting with a point and shoot. 

If you are finding yourself wanting a little more than a point and shoot, go for this camera, you wont be sorry.

I purchased this camera a year ago (summer 05).  Definitely a great upgrade over the original rebel, although the new xti has a larger screen which is the one aspect of this camera that is not perfect.  There are other sites that will perform more comprehensive reviews of this camera, but after a year mine is still working perfectly

I am new to SLRs and I cant belive how good this camera is.  This camera is worth every penny for the amazing quality it produces.   I always thot my old digital pics with point and shoot were excellent, but looking back, they look terrible compared to this.

I had 2 Rebel cameras so it just made sense for me to pick up this digital camera and attach my old lenses.  While I had owned other digitals I keep going back to my old Rebel, until now.  We got the back up battery pack.  My husband and I love it

Canon makes a great underwater housing for a reasonable price.  I purchased this for a recent trip to Grand Cayman and Cozumel.  I didn't go Scuba diving on this trip, but I did take the camera snorkeling (diving to depths ~20ft).  It worked flawlessly and I got some pictures I was very happy with!  One thing I did not anticipate was the use the camera got out of the water.  Going from AC to the hot humid outdoors, my EOS rebel fogged up (condensation) and even after 30 minutes I couldn't take good pictures.  With the SD110 in the UW housing, I just wipped the housing's glass portal with a lens tissue after it had warmed up a couple of minutes and I was able to take clear pictures. 

The instructions are pretty good, but it took me a while to figure out how to take out the O-ring seal for cleaning/lubing.  Once I figured it out, it wasn't so hard.

The SD110 may be getting a little old, but it still takes decent pictures and even with the housing I don't have so much money tied up in the system that I would be devestated if it was lost or stolen.  I will probably upgrade to the SD550 or SD500 (they both use the same batteries as the SD110) with the WP-DC80 or WP-DC70 housing at some time in the near future, but I will definitely keep the SD110 and WP-DC10 as backups

Pros:
- Reduces flare and ghosting when shooting in bright light.
- Helps protect your lens from dirt and scratches.
- Somewhat protects the lens in case of a fall.  Better to break the hood than the front element.
- Makes you look more like you know what you are doing and helps to keep others from carelessly walking in front of you.

Cons:
- Will increase lens movement in windy situations, kind of like a sail on a boat.
- Takes up more room in your bag, even when reversed they still add to the diameter of the lens.
- People take more notice of you, will help to blow your cover if you are trying to keep a low profile

When I bought a digital camera, I already knew that I would need rechargeable batteries for it. What I didn't realize was how quickly the camera would eat the supplied alkalines. I had taken barely a dozen pictures before they were drained to the point where the camera would no longer operate!

So I looked for a set of rechargeable batteries and a charger and quickly settled on this one because of previous experience with Monster Cable's products.

It performs better than advertised. The initial charge may have taken 3 hours, but subsequent charges have been much quicker. I have yet to drain these batteries to the point where they won't operate the camera. The charger itself is an attractive unit for an appliance, and has an LED indicator that lights up red for charging and changes to green to indicate fully charged. It is compact enough to fit comfortably in the camera bag and the plug folds into the back of it.

I have had good service from it and can highly recommend this charger

I bought one of these for my Canon SD-800 and can recommend it.  For many years now, I've carried Canon pocket cameras on my belt while traveling and the Canon-branded cases are simply the best for this purpose.  My only criticism of the Canon cases has been their lack of a small pocket for media.  I was hoping that with the tiny size of SD cards Canon would have added such a pocket to their newer cases, but they haven't.  On the plus side, the case retains the superior leather construction, uses a neat magnetic tie down for the flap instead of Velcro or a snap, and has a belt loop that is tight enough to hold the camera comfortably against your body.  The package also includes a nice looking leather replacement strap for your camera.  Incidentally, the SD-800 is well matched to the case, fitting quite securely

Excellent case, no question about it. It is stylish and well-put together. This can not be worn on a belt, though, it must go in a pocket, purse, or in your hand. The main thing is that it keeps the awesome camera safe and sound, and it looks good doing it.

Photos were excellent. But photo print quality depends very much on the print shop. For the same photo file, it can look like a 4M photo when taken to a below quality printer shop. Photos taken indoor with marginal lighting (no flash used) turned out to be yellowish. Battery life is very long despite its large 3" LCD. Battery charging time is over 3 hours - too long. Photos files viewed on computer looks just great. 8'x10' prints are great but have not tried larger prints. Touch screeen control is a delight and very easy to choose and set. Date on photo is red (would be better if it is black). And the location of the date is not at the far right hand corner

I've had my D70s for about a year now, haven't regretted it for a second. 

The controls are laid out logically, with everything to hand. The dual control wheels make adjustments fast and accurate. I personally love the optional grid overlay, I have no excuses for horizons that aren't horizontal. The wireless flash system is great, though you have to buy an SB-600 or SB-800 to get the full benefit. This camera is bigger and heavier than the D50 and D80, which in my opinion is a positive thing.

I do weddings, portrait, and outdoor photography and I don't see any reason why I'd ever switch from the D70 (other than the D80 :).  This camera is professional grade at the consumer price point.  Don't be scared by the 6.1 MP.  I print at 20x30 all the time w/ out any problems.  I'd recommend reading Thom Hogans manual

This UV filter does it job to protect the lens well. The build is solid (metal construction). The glass is also descent quality. 

About the performance, it absorbs some UV light. The UV light absorbtion is hardly noticeable, probably the sky 1-A and the haze filter version will absorb more UV light than this lens which is fine for me. 

Now, about the one problem which is the internal reflection. I've heard many people say that it mostly happens during night or low light shooting. I found out that it is not caused directly by the low light/night situation. The internal reflection will appear when there is a strong/bright source of light in comparison to the overall exposure (the surrounding environment). To put it in example (which hopefully is easier to understand), when you take a picture of a lamp during nightime and the light is much brighter than the surrounding area then you will see the internal reflection. as you move the position of the light to be closer to the sides/corner of the picture (and not in the center of the picture), the internal reflection reduces and finally dissapear (if you move the light far enough from the center). And if the light isn't too bright/contrast compare to the surrounding environment then there will be no internal reflection. but of course most of the time, a lamp at nightime is often very bright. But the point that I'm trying to make is that the internal reflection doesn't happen all the time during low light or night time. 

Additionally, the internal reflection isn't only happening at night. it can also happen in the afternoon if you are taking a picture of a sun for example. basically same rule as above, on how bright is the light source compared to the surrounding area, and as you move the sun from the center of the photo and near the side the internal reflection will move to the side/dissapear (also depending the angle). But the best way is just to remove the filter during these situations. 

Hope this explanation helps you to reduce the occurence of internal reflection by identifying correctly when the internal reflection will occur and then remove the filter during those situation (which is not hard to do). 

I'm actually not a fan of lens filter (any filter) as I think it will only degrade picture quality as we added another layer between the sensor and object, but I decided to use them anyway for all my lens. And I would recommend everyone to get one of this filter if you don't have any filter for your lens yet. 

I use this filter on my 50mm f/1.8D lens and on my 18-55mm lens.

If you are looking for a great all around camera, this is it!  Our kids play sports and are in constant motion and the sports mode captures it all.  Also love the "Last 4" feature, gets some great action shots.  We had the Fuji 7000 before this and they have definately fixed the features that bugged me.  Love the new manual zoom (if you like 35mm lenses your like this) as well as the battery drain.  I used to have to replace batteries every day, now its more like once a week with the amount we use it.  My other favorite feature is the dual memory slots for those times where I forget to put it back in the camera after downloading!  So there is always one in there!.  The video comes out great and with the new manual lens you can zoom during video shots.  In general, without spending A LOT MORE, you get a great camera that keeps up with an active "picture happy" family

I'm using it for a few months now; I haven't found a single problem so far. Earlier, I was using an old FinePix and the optic/sensor sensitivity was not very good; poor quality of photos taken in dark environment. This is not a problem any more. Also, I was impressed with the sharpness of photos of sport actions taken with 10x zoom. In general, I was pretty enthusiastic about all the features of this camera; it took me nearly 3 days to try everything out :-). Sure, there are better cameras on the market; however, considering the price it is just a great deal

The quality is definitely great. When attached to the S3 IS, it makes your camera look serious about taking good shots. If you are attaching the hood and doing flash photography, I suggest you use a slave flash to eliminate the shadow caused by the hood

I use my Canon 10d mainly for Astrophotography. Most of the time, 
it involves keeping the camera shutter open for long periods of 
time, anywhere from a few minutes to tens of minutes. This ACK-E2
adapter takes my worries away from monitoring battery status or a 
drained one, while i control the camera remotely sitting inside my 
house. Continuous power also ensures worry free writes to its flash
storage. The package included several AC power connectors which is 
very useful while travelling. Amazon provides a wide range of items 
to choose from.

I bought this lens on a whim to see what it would be like to shoot with a prime lens. At $80 it certainly was worth the risk unlike the many other Canon lenses which cost thousands of dollars. The quality of the pictures from this lens is the only thing making me move away from zoom lenses

This is a fabulous and reliable camera. Feels solid. Fantastic pictures. Easy to operate. A new D40 has been announced over the past few days, but its lack of an LCD display and buttons to manage basic camera controls (to reduce weight and make it more user friendly) would still make this my recommended Nikon DSLR. Expect prices to fall as the D40 becomes available

I am not a photographer, but I enjoy taking good pictures. I never had a digital SLR before; the camera I had before the D50 was a Nikon Coolpix (a compact one). I thought this would have been a good camera for someone who enjoys good pictures without being a pro. I realized that it was even better than what I expected (maybe because I was coming from a Nikon Coolpix). The colors are amazing and the quality of the picture is extremely good.
The D50 is among the cheapest digital SLR's, and, at the same time, it is a very serious product. I don't think the D50 is much inferior to the Canon Rebel, even if the Canon has 2 more megapixels of resolution. I used both the D50 (which I own) and the Rebel (at my school) and I think the D50 feels much more like a "pro camera" when you hold it in your hands, while the Rebel feels more like a toy.
The lenses provided in the package are good, but are basic. According to me the 18-55 is better than the 28-80, but I think I should have bought the 55-200 as well: 18 to 200 covers most of the pictures that you can take. Also the 18-135 that Nikon sells with the D80 looks good to me, but they don't make a kit with those lenses for the D50.

The last thing that really amazes me is the .NEF format (Nikon's RAW format). It is impressive how quickly you can improve a .NEF picture with your computer in just very few clicks of mouse.

If you want a good camera, and you don't want to spend too much money for it I think this is the best choice

I purchased this at a photographic store because a professional said you shouldn't go higher than 1.4x.  Just keep in mind--1.4x is only "40% better".  It worked really well, but didn't increase the zoomage enough.  I decided to go with a 2x (that's twice the zoomage) teleconverter by kenko instead.  I gave this one to my brother-in-law for Christmas.

You have to think about what you want--I want to get in really close to the birds.  I have a 70-300mm zoom lens and 1.4x takes it to 98-420mm.  It is an improvement, but not nearly enough!  If you want to get twice as close, this isn't going to do it for you.  If you want to get half-again-as close, this almost gets you there.  

As far as quality, the quality is definitely there. Five stars for quality, 3 for insufficient zoomage

My first digicam, bought it 2 years ago. 
Simple to use, great pictures, and a year ago (and hundreds of pictures ago) I dropped it (no in its case) on a cobblestone road - no damage.
Have never seen the need to replace it.
I like the common batteries it uses and the SD memory

Aside form the fact that Canon charges an arm and a leg for a 1 dollar piece of plastic, the remote switch does work well.  It does not feel very sturdy and does not seem nearly as well built as the Canon cameras.  People with big hands may have a little trouble using this product.  Overall, a "must have" addition for anyone interested in long exposures, images with excellent sharpness and depth of field

It is simple, handy and works well to prevent shaking your camera. But I am still doubt if this simple accessory really deserves 50 bucks... This wired release would be the choice only if you are not a Digital Rebel user who has a more reasonable price option for the additional shutter button.

I honestly don't see why people would give this camera less than 4 stars. The moment I got it, I was delighted with the quality of the pictures (except in very dark places - which is why the review gets minus 1 star), and by its portability.

I've dropped it, abused it, took it to countless parties, countries and it is now FULL of scratches and bumps (GET THE CAMERA CASE!), and guess what: it still works as perfectly as the first day I got it. This little piece of technology is amazing, so if you're looking for something affordable and with a great picture quality (for us amateurs, of course) just go for it. ACtually, I even took quite a few gorgeous pictures with it. I even love it and rely on it so much that I won't change it even now that it looks all messed up.

Don't think twice. Just go for it

Had looked at this lens both at the camera shop and on line and finally decided after much comparison with other lenses to finally purchase it, have'nt regretted it one bit. This lens is clear with excellent color, saturation and sharpness without any or minimal post processing. Coupled with an external flash it's great indoors as well. Have been using it as my everyday walk around lens. Zoom range is excellent(Rebel XT/XTi 1.6 magnification). Though it's somewhat on the big side, it won't tire you out carrying it around your neck. Purchased the hood seperately which, for the money should have came with the lens. 
Anyway, this lens offers excellent value for the money and you won't regret the investment

This is the first IS lens that I've owned. I had trouble justifying the extra expense but am now quite pleased that I took the step up. 

Keep in mind that tis is an EF not EF-S lens. This makes its effective focal length about 45-215mm on my Digital Rebel.

I love the zoom range (great for shooting action shots of kids without getting in their faces) and the ability to easily control the depth of field on my nature shots.

Just uploaded some of my recent shots with this lens under "Share your own customer images".

From all the reviews I read, I expected certain pros and cons from this lens.  I was not disappointed.
pros:  very sharp lens with very good colors
cons:  vignetting at wide open, and a little too contrasty
For myself, the pros outweighed the cons for the price.  It is ideal for the 1.6 multiplier cameras, where it becomes a 38mm lens

This kit is a must have for any of the compatible Canon cameras. Digital camera rule #1: ALWAYS carry a spare battery - the kit is almost worth it for  that alone. The leather case is great: stylish looks that provides a tough protective armor in case you drop the camera. The neck strap is quite strong and looks good too. It may not be everyone's cup of tea but I like it. It comes in handy when I need quick access to the camera and don't want to fumble through pockets or bags

I've had my D2H for 9 months now. I've heard of the magenta skin tones issue but have never seen it..skin tones on my unit are great. It seems this issue plagued a minority of users.

Camera is very fast, exposes well and delivers results. It's primarily designed to be a sports and Photojournalism camera -- for situations where speed counts. It's a 4 megapixel wonder -- it's true it only has 4 megapixels, but they are 4 GREAT megapixels. Images upsize wonderfully. 

I love my unit, and am debating whether to buy a second one as a backup, or wait for the D2X. The price of the D2x is making that decision a bit easier and I'm leaning toward another D2H.

I have had my Canon Eos 30D for about a week and after 500 shutter actuations I am completely addicted to photography.  I bought the 17-85mm Canon lens and it takes phenomenal pics especially using the software and post-processing in RAW.  I also have a 70-300mm lens for sports/outdoors/nature and bursts of 5fps are a beautiful sound.  I bought the Camera through Dell and with rebates currently this is the best deal out there!  Strongly recommend.  Pay the extra $$$ and get this over the Rebel XTI.  You won't be disappointed

I upgraded from the Canon Digital Rebel (grey body) to this because I was ready to take my photography to a new level. One thing I like most about this camera is it's flash compenstation. I purchased the 430ex flash with it because I was tired of having to use the built in flash and always getting those hard shadows on the wall

The Philips Digital Frame truly stands out from all other digital pictures frames that I've gotten.  The resolution and picture quality superb, and the sleek outer design is an additional plus.  Also, the picture frame can be charged and last a couple of hours without a cord, which is very convenient. 

As another reviewer said, you have to scroll through your entire collection one-by-one on your memory card in order for you to get to the picture you want.  It would be more convenient if you could skip through pages or have a BlackBerry type rolling scroll on the side of the frame to speed through if you needed to.  

Also, I would like to see Philips next frame include a flashdrive slot as well, that way we can upload pictures from our computers to the USB flash drive and directly insert the flash drive into the frame without tranferring them onto a memory card. 

Thank you

The battery is great, but Amazon offers the accessory kit with the same battery, plus a mini-dv tape and a carrying case for the same price.  The case is useless for the ZR series, but might come in handy for some other purpose

It's well designed, the protection is very good, but you should know it's pretty compact, you can put only the camera inside, nothing else.

Also take care about the color, it has some pink on it, if you are a relly macho and worry about it, better look for options

I am very happy with the resulting prints from this camera.  I've used other brands in the past and never have had such bright colors and in focus shots.  The winding mechanism is easy to use.  Finally I have pictures of my diving expeditions to remember.

It's even suited for kids over ten to use.  Mine had lots of fun with their own Quick Snap

  This camera is perfect for me I have a [...] an a [...] an it always seems there doing something ide like to catch on film. This camcorder is small enough that some days I have it in my jacket pocket an the instant on makes it really easy to catch them moments that are usually gone by the time you get them big cameras out of the bag an ready to go. Also it can extract a still picture out of a video clip so them candid shots are never missed. 
  The settings for this camera are really easy to understand an use.
  It takes really good video's an pictures although Ive not taken alot of still pictures because I like to extract that perfect picture out of a video clip. This camera takes video cards so your not always downloading onto your pc. Ive got a few 2 gig cards so ive always have one in the camera ready to go. 
  The battery does not last a long time so I recommend a couple extra, there pretty cheep here on Amazon an it usually takes one battery to download onto pc if you have it hooked up to your PC for any lengh of time. 
  I dont know anything about camera's an how they work I just like to take the pictures an so far this has been the easiest camera /camcorder ive seen

I received the XACTi a few weeks ago and it's performing like I hoped it would.  The controls are a very simple and intuitive.  All the required hardware is included.  Does not require any additional software to run on Mac or Windows.

I have a MacBook with Boot Camp running Windows XP Pro.  The camera works easily with either platform.  It is recognized as another drive and does not require any additional software to download the images and movies onto the hardrive.  I am using a SanDisk 2gb SD memory card.

Another big plus is not having to wait while downloading real-time like you would have to with miniDV.  The quality may not be the same as miniDV but the convenience and ease of use make up for the difference.  The quality is much better than a digital camera when taking movies and people will think it's just a camera by it's small size.

My old camera was a 2 mega pixel Canon Powershot A60.  This is rated at 6 mega pixel.  You can definitely see the difference in the pictures and movies.  When filming movies, the higher frames per second sample rate makes the images smooth, even when taking pictures of high speed objects like helicopter rotor blades and airplane propellers.

This is my first camcorder so I can't really compare to anything else (except my old camera) but the ease of use will make you want to use it all the time and people will start to tell you to put that thing away

I going to write the for non techs out there...

I can use it, my wife can use it, my mom can use it and my 5 year old son can use it. It is just that simple to use. You do not need to know anything about taking shots, other than how to zoom and pick the right settings, and if you play with the camera for a few days you will know them.
One other reviewer said to get the following:
1. At least a 512 MB Memory Stick Pro Duo to take 160 or so pictures in one go
2. Rechargeable AA batteries and a charger
3. Case

and i must say YES, YES and YES... to all, they are a must...

This camera, feels good in your hands, screen size is great. You can see the screen in both sunlight and at nights.
The menu is very easy to follow and the quality of the picture are clean and clear.
i can't comment on the software that comes with the camera as i have a Apple computer and i use iPhoto.
For the price, i felt like i got a $[...] Sony...

I'm a former 35mm photographer who's a little older and not as spry as I once was and I eventually got out of the habit of lugging a case of equipment everywhere I went.  I got re-energized in photography with digital but a small compact point and shoot left me wanting more.  Digital SLR's are pricey and as a friend pointed out I'd be back to lugging a case of equipment around me with her.  She recommended this model and the more I looked at it the more I liked it. 
It is a fixed lens model, but with a 12:1 optical zoom what other lenses would really need.  It start up fast, zooms and focuses internally so there is no moving barrel to have to hold on to.  It has just about every feature an advanced amateur could want.  It does macro.  And it has an optical stablization system that works as advertised.  
So far I haven't come across anything that it can't do.  This is a nice unit for an advanced amateur or even semi-pro who doesn't want to go full digital SLR yet.

I am only an amateur photographer, but still . . . this small camera with the long nose gives performance one might expect from an SLR film camer costing a lot more, and a lot more complicated to use. I caught the digital bug sevearl years ago. My latest before this beauty was a simple little Canon SureShot 3mp. A great camera, but this camera has the same simplicity, but takes pictures which are much more refined in terms of sharpeness for not much more than I paid for that camera four years ago!! This Panasonic Lumix has a Leica Lens, which can' t be matched by any other camera but it's twin Leica camera--a much more expensive piece of equipment. The long lens might put you off if you are an average family photog, but if you want an all around 35mm-12X camera without a huge heavy expensive bag of lenses, like me, this baby is for you. It only looks massive. It is quite lite and manageable. I use it for bird photographsy, but it could be great for any situation where you need to get really close up in just about any lighting situation with ultra-fine resolution. Don't want to spend mega bucks for a mega-camera? This is the answer. I love it, and I think your will, too. Easy to use, and easy on the wallet. If you're not quite there, try the next model down, with the same focal length but 6 mp, for a couple hundred less. Another terrific buy. No, I don't work for Panasanic. I'm a retired print editor.

I am a busy mom of two young children.  This camera is perfect for capturing all of their cute faces and happy moments.  I love the fast cycle time. I love that I can take multiple pictures in seconds. Would recommend to anyone

Unlike many reviewers I am not diver.  I bought this to for the peace of mind that my camera wouldn't get ruined taking pictures of my son at the water park, pool, and beach.  This equipment exceeded my expectations with always clear photo and underwater flash.

This case has out lived an S400 and S500.

Well worth the $170 price tag

Being in Hawaii, I spend plenty of time in the water...so having an underwater housing for my camera is almost a necessity.  I have been very happy with the results, shooting in the water (snorkeling, etc) and above the water (surf footage-just watch out for water spots on the lens).  Some of my photos are up for view in other parts of the page for this housing.

I treat things pretty roughly, and have been using this for about a year with no problems.  And I am in the water with it on an almost daily basis.  I like being able to use all the features of the camera (minus downloading images or changing the battery or CF card) while the camera is in the housing-something you cannot always say when looking at aftermarket housings that are non-Canon manufactured.  Everything mates up cleanly and works great, I am very happy with my purchase.

Just remember to rinse it off/soak it in freshwater after taking it in the ocean or the pool to keep the corrosion at bay, and put a little light silicone grease on the o-ring for trouble free use

I just bought this waterproof case in order to use my Canon s410 on a scuba diving trip.  I was a little nervous at first (I could see me scrapping the camera after it got soaked to the bone!), but I have to say that the waterproof case performed admirably!  I used it on 6 dives, and all of them were to depths of 80+ feet.  I did not have one leak!  A word of caution--I followed instructions and coated the seal of the camera with a fine coat of silicon gel (just a small amount).  I would like to think that the camera would not leak without this, but I did not want to take any chances.

I would recommend this case to anyone who wants to use their Canon camera on dive trips or excursions at the beach

300 plus minutes of recording time (without LCD). I still got several hours with the LCD, backlight on.

For when you are out all day, this is a good long lasting battery.

On the HDR-FX1 I found it preferable to the smaller and lighter battery as it helped provide a touch extra rear weighting. That helped balance when using the camcorder at hip height for me. I can't say I noticed the extra weight as an issue when using at shoulder height, though I didn't have it on my shoulder for long periods at a time

Bought this camera to replace my 35mm camera.  Am pleased with the trade up that I made.

The shape is similar to my old film camera.  Thought this would make it easier to adjust to the smaller size of it.  It has made the transition relatively smooth.  I'm sure there are smaller cameras out there, but this one is small enough.  The display is also a good size - bigger than most that I looked at.

I am not a genius at computers, so I was concerned that I would need to adapt to downloading pictures from the camera to the PC.  But, all I need to do is plug in the cord and click a button.  Very easy to follow any instructions.

I did notice that the display "freezes" for a second or two after a picture is taken.  This is not generally a problem for me as most pictures are posed shots.  I did run into some lag time during an Easter egg hunt this past weekend, but still managed to get about a dozen good shots.

Overall, I like the camera and only wish I had gotten up the courage to go digital sooner

I bought my Canon A540 recently from Amazon and am completely satisfied. I added a 1Gb SD card for $11 from Ebay and a charger with 4 2500NiMH AA batteries from the supermarket.  The images are clear and large. You have the options of full automatic, various manual settings up to full manual and a wide selection of preprogrammed modes.  

At work we needed a new camera to record tiny scratches and imperfections in our manufactured product, so I took my camera in to demo. Using the standard lens (a macro lens is available but I don't have it yet) we photographed a quarter using only ambient light. In less than a minute we had the image on the screen and were able to blow it up until the date filled the screen and still maintain good detail.  As a result we are now buying one for work with a macro accessory lens.

I totally recommend it as an excellent all rounder

When I purchased this camera I was really conflicted on wheather I should get a digital still camera or a digital video camera.  So when I decided still and found out the Canon PowerShot had a video feature, I was pleased but had very low expectations.  BOY WAS I SUPRISED!  This camera has so many fun features for both still and video pics.  And the quality is awesome for both!  There is a video email option so you don't have to guess if your videos are going to fit into an email.  But if you want you can create some really good quality video with a quick adjustment.  And all of it transfers easily to my computer.

Plus with still pics there are lots of easy features to choose from so you can quickly set up for any kind of shooting sinario.

I purchased this camera for shooting product photos for our website. I had been using a Nikon Coolpix at 5mp and wanted something relatively low cost with higher mp for the next few years. We plan to purchase something totally outlandish in a few years for super-quality printed photos, but for now, this camera is an excellent investment. Easy and small enough for everyone in the company to carry on trips abroad, but inexpensive enough to not break our hearts if pocket-picked or eaten by a hyena.

I've read some reviews that talk about blurred photos...I'm really surprised. I began using ours after I had my son, so many photos were taken without a tripod, one hand holding a nursing child and the other shooting photos...and none of the images turned out blurry. I have taken a few photos of my son now that he's a six-month-old super action hero that look like cotton candy on my Nikon but turn out crystal clear on the Sony. 

The movie mode is a real plus. I'm actually on this page today because I'm looking to buy one of these for my personal use with video recording in mind. We have a digital video camera, but with plenty of 1G memory cards in hand, I'd rather record action with this camera--the quality and sound are worlds better.

This is a lovely little low-cost camera that's suitable for a wide range of users.  I love it

Good camera for the $129 I paid. Does everything pretty well, and your picture modes are pretty customizable. Only qualm is it takes a second or two longer than I wish when the camera saves/loads pictures to the memory card. Might be a problem when trying to shoot consecutive pictures-- but probably wouldn't be doing it with this type of camera anyways.

We canoe/kayak down various rivers and creeks.  I wanted a way to take my $1500 camera on the water without fear of damaging it.  

The Sports Pack is completely water proof (up to 7m).  I've submersed the case in a test and in a real-life situation and the camera stayed dry.  

The case does not cause any noticeable reduction in picture quality. It is relatively simple to operate and assemble. You have only the basic functions of the camera while in the case, so you need to change any setting for the camera before putting it in the case and advanced camera features are not able to be used.

My only concern is the scratch resistance of the plastic over the lens area.  So far I haven't had any problems but I've only taken on the river for about 30 hrs.

All told, I'm very pleased and if you plan on filming in or near water I would recommend this case

It is rated for 5 meters but I took it to 9 and there were no sings of moisture or a single drop. The antifogging solution provided works for more than an hour. The microphone records sound well. I have a High Def cam and the S.Pack did not decrease image quality inside or outside the water. In the specs it is stated that its buoyancy is positive, and by experience I recomend to buy a weight for it to avoid the camera going up in the water while you push and push down - even more snorkeling. There are special weights that are mounted to the enclosure using the trypod whole. I would say a 14-18 onz it fine.
It is a great item

For its size and price, this little light can't be beat. Very transportable and produces a dramatic influence on the image quality of evening shoots indoors. I think this is a must have for camcorder owners. My VHS family movies shot over 20 years ago are still a source of pure joy, so I see this as a miniscule investment for the long-term return.

In short, I love it. 
The XH A1 is a professional looking camera and has all the features you need.
It is a bit complex for those who are not true prosumers or pros, and the manual is not consumer oriented.

The picture qualitity is, so far, the best I've seen in non-pro cameras. The 3 CCDs at 1/3 inch each are truely spectacular. 


The 2 external XLR connections are the reason I looked at this camera. If you want to mic someone via wireless or wired lav mic, this is the camer to do that. Just make sure you read over the XLR connection settings in the manual a few times and change the buttons (unfortunately located in 4 different locations on the camera) to the right settings. A set of good headphones is a must-have when not using the wonderful built-in mic. By the way, this built-in mic eliminated one of the situations where I always needed a mic, a close up interview situation--the built-in is very sensitive and accurate for this type of thing.

The downside to this camera is really only that it does NOT contain an HDMI adapter. Sadly CANON did not provide one; instead they opted for a custom (HDMI-looking) adpater that if you loose the cable you can't run down to Fry's or Radio Shack to get another one. :(

The other thing is that it is 1440x1080 instead of 1920x1080.  Their new CANON HV20 ( a 1CCD camera due in April 2007) is 1920x1080 resolution--just seems odd to me.  But then I'm the guy that will get a 10 Megapixel camera simply because its better resolution. :)

The bottom line, don't get the Sony FX7, get this one. The Sony seems and is easier to use, but it doesn't have an external XLR jack, it uses 1/4 inch CCDs, and in a side-by-side test doesn't offer as good performance in low light situations as this one.

The camera is a bit complicated, but if you're willing to learn, it is a wonderful tool.
If you need true point and shoot, I'd wait and get the CANON HV20

I looked at this camera the Panasonic hvx200, the sonys, the jvc 200, and even Canon's bigger brother the X1. I found this one to have fantastic reviews on DVinfo.net, a great video forum. My concerns about 24f vs 24p were addressed to my satisfaction- there really isn't a difference. I like tape vs the HVX's expensive storage solutions. One concern I had was, will it look like a pro camera? That is important in some situations where your equipment gives you added credibilty with clients and talent. 

As soon as I opened the box I was in love! This is a really substantial camera. Especially with the opt wide angle from Canon and the matte box provided, this does not look like your mama's camcorder.

I really like the manual controls, so that you don't have to go thru menus to change parameters. The layout of everything is great. I really like the dual on/off and zoom controls- top of handle plus rear right side. Holding the handle for low or medium height shots is very, very comfortable and the controls are perfectly positioned. 

Only down side- and it is incidental. The matte box is a bit flimsy- lightweight plastic. That helps with weight, but I worry about breaking it. Some may say that HDV codec is not as good as DVCpro, but my eye does not see it. The colors are magnificent and it blows away many other cams in low-light.

If you are looking for point and shoot, this is not your baby, but if you want a pro quality camera for a really great price- this is it

I don't like pink so I bought the blue bag.  I had bought a black one, but it was so skimpy I returned it and prayed until this one arrived. I had no trouble with Amazon crediting me for the return, either.  It was so cute!  I'm too old for "cute," but I kept it because I needed a case for my new HP R717.  It is small, yet padded enough to trust that your camera will be cushioned if you drop it.  I have dropped my camera and it was not injured.  It has a little pouch inside to store an extra battery for my camera, not the big AA batteries, but the flat type that come with my R717.  I recommend this little bag, or the pink one, even if you don't like pink...or blue.  They are well cushioned and snug, but not too snug you think they will tear.  The are sturdy and have nice shoulder straps and magnet closures

I bought this for my new HDV FX1 Camcorder, and it works great.  Unlike the Century wide-angle lens, this is fully zoom-through.  Lens is .8x, which is less than the Century and others, but just about right for HD--since the FX1 already can do a pretty decent wide shot when the zoom is fully backed out, this just gives it an extra boost, converting the camera view from roughly a 35mm lens on a 35mm camera to about a 28mm.  Also, very little barrel distortion.

In all a great lens.  Only drawback is that it's a big (heavy) lens, but then, hey, it's for a serious prosumer camcorder

I recently purchased this camera.  It arrived one day before I was due to fly out to Palm Springs.  I took lots of pictures with this camera and was pleased with all of them except the night time pictures.  This may or may not be because I am a novice photographer. Even with the night time setting my pictures came out blurry, but all others came out better than I ever expected.  I think once I play around with it, my night time pictures will improve, but straight out the box this was kinda disappointing to me.  No regrets with this purchase though.  Also, buy a larger memory stick.  The one that comes with the camera only stored 6 pictures and I had to run out and buy another.

I purchased this camera so I could photograph wildlife on hikes.  I needed something that was not too heavy, was image-stabilized, with telephoto power.  This camera meets all those requirements.  It does have one problem, however.  In bright light, the viewfinder blanks out, so one cannot clearly see the object to be photographed.  I have solved that problem to some extent, by pointing the camera at the object, and letting the autofocus do the rest.  This "fix" has resulted in many excellent photos.  Like many other small cameras, the results tend to be contrasty, and I modify this tendency in photoshop

I love my new Canon A710.  Large LCD makes taking pictures easy to frame, color and sharpness is good all around and needing only 2 AA batteries is great.  I no longer need to search and buy special camera batteries, I can go into any drug store.

Only draw back on this camera is the size of the memory card 16mb.  For a few bucks more put in at least a 1Gig.

Overall rating for a camera in this price range - above average

Overall, I am quite satisfied with the usability and photo quality of the Canon A 710 IS.  This camera was an upgrade from my 3-year-old HP 935 -- the old guy still worked fine, but was very slow and didn't handle low-light situations very well at all.  I was also looking for a bigger zoom range.  After weighing the options, I decided that the A 710 IS was the way to go.  

Pros:
- Uses standard AA batteries.  Invaluable when you're on the go and need more juice.  Also, the battery life has been very good - I'm using the same AA rechargables I used for over a year in my old camera, and I routinely get 2-4 days usage from them before needing to recharge. 

- Huge LCD screen that doesn't suck power.  Fast response, too.

- Digital zoom that actually helps!  Because the camera is 7.1 MP and has an image stabilizer, I can actually get usable images even at the full 24x combined zoom.  Very impressed.

- Very wide range of available settings.  You can customize almost any aspect of this camera, from sounds to shutter speed to flash speed/brightness to focus to....

- Big enough, and small enough.  It will fit in my back pocket most of the time, but it's big enough to remind me that it's there before I sit down.  

- Fast processing time.  Taking a 3 or 4 minute video and having it ready to go again in less than 5 seconds is a true novelty to me -- my old HP took forever!  The fast processor also helps in viewing the images on the camera - you can scroll through very quickly, and also jump to an image very quickly too.  Much better than previous Canon models even.

- Memory backup battery.  Remembers what day it is, time it is, and what image you're on -- even if you take the regular AA's out.  Very useful.

- Fast start-up time.  It's ready to take a picture right after you turn it on, especially if you bypass the "welcome" image sound and screen.

- Cool features, like color swap and color select.  Also, there's an option for when the camera is connected to your computer to set any image as your computer's wallpaper with just the press of a button on the camera.  The camera also allows you to use the digital zoom while taking video, a nice touch.

- You can change lenses and add filters very easily.


Cons:
- As I mentioned earlier, one of the reasons I upgraded from the HP was to have better luck with low-light situations.  I've had the camera now for just over a month, and I still haven't figured out the best setting for clear, low-light photos -- something that was very easy to do with older Canon models, say, the A 510.  As mentioned, there is a wide range of settings available, which can also be a negative if you don't know quite what you're looking for.

- No "action" setting.  Similar to above, the one setting I miss the most from other Canons is that action setting.  This camera requires you to set it manually.

- Video file sizes.  A typical 4-minute clip can run upwards of 200 MB -- making it almost impossible to send via email or upload anywhere online.  Also takes up a good chunk of a 1MB memory card, really quickly.  Canon would have done better to use MPEG-4 here instead of AVI.  

- Similarly, the video quality doesn't reflect the large file size in most cases, though the sound quality is very good.

- The big LCD is great, but is very hard to see outside in the sun.  It does have a backup optical viewfinder, but using that puts your nose up against that LCD and leaves a nice smudge on it if you're not careful.

- Buttons are still somewhat confusing after a month of use, but that's relatively minor and will undoubtedly pass with time.  

- Bundled software does not offer the ability to resize your images -- I have to go back through the old HP software if I want to take an image down from 3000 pixels wide to 600!  



Overall, as mentioned, the camera is a huge improvement from my old HP, and even with all of those little annoyances, I'm sure the camera would be a perfect fit for pretty much any amateur-to-intermediate photog.  It's no SLR, but it's getting there.  And, you certainly can't beat the price

For years now I have been buying "bargain" cameras with the foolish notion that I did not need a nice one. Finally, I got sick of it and bought the Exilim EX-Z600. This camera is awesome. The screen is huge, the picture quality is great, it is easy to use and is sooo small. Overall, a great buy.

The one downside is that I can only connect it to my computer using the dock. Luckily, I have an SD card reader, so I normally just use that to download my pictures

After a week of testing this camcorder, I found it good enough for daily use.  The HD2 does not come with an SD card, so make sure you buy one before or at the time you get the HD2.  I got a 2GB SD A-DATA and a 4GB SDHC QPI Class6.  Both worked fine.  The 4GB gives me about 1:20h in StandardHD mode, and 55mns in SuperHD mode.  I didn't notice a speed difference between a Class2 and a Class6 SD card using the HD2, I think you should be fine with an 8GB SDHC class2.
My first impression of the camera is how small it is, however it may not fit in a jean pocket.  It turns on very quick, you can start filming within 2secs of startup.  It has a lady voice telling the mode you are using (ie camera mode), not sure if this is useful for others, but not for me.
The video and still pictures are great outdoor.  The video quality is impressive during a bright sunlight.  In a room lighten by a 60W equivalent fluo light, the video quality is grainy/noisy, this has been confirmed by other people as well.  The High Sensitivity feature (to boost the image quality at low light) helps but not enough.  My 7yrs old Sony DIgital8 does a better job at 1lux.  I noticed that video quality is grainy at low light, but 7MP still picture quality is very good for the same lighting.  Compared to my new Canon SD800 at 7MP, it is obvious the Canon Digital Camera wins.  On the video side, I played with several configuration, ISO setting, white balance, resolution, etc... It does helps, but the video is still grainy at low light.  This camcorder has not been designed for low light filming.  
I ran into an issue when transfering the video &amp; Pictures from the HD2 with its cradle to the PC via USB connection.  I got errors transfering the files if you use the craddle (this will freeze the HD2).  I am not sure why, I have to check with Sanyo on this.  If you connect the HD2 directly to the PC (without the cradle), the transfer goes smooth.  So there is an issue with the cradle and USB port.
I am also using Pinnacle Studio 10.5 for my video editing.  So far, I have not been able to use it and control my HD2.  You can however copy the files from SD to your PC, and use these files with Pinnacle Studio.
Since I film most of the time outdoor during daytime, this camera does the job fine and video quality is great.  I would still give a 5 stars even with the video issues at low light.

The ZR500 and other low-end Canon camcorders appear to be very fine products, well worth their price -- but if what you want is the simplest and easiest way to make perfectly acceptable amateur-level home videos, have a look at the RCA Small Wonder.  

Simple, rugged, totally easy to learn and operate, no frills but still some very neat features, takes perfectly adequate videos of your children, your dog, whatever -- and about half the price.  Bought one; totally satisfied

This case was well thought out for snorkeling/diving and using your own digital camera without going to the expense of a really expensive camera.  Definitely a better choice than using those throw-away underwater cameras or renting one.  
The only drawback is that it triples the size of the great 720SW camera - since size is one of its strongpoint

I bought this camera to take pictures of my family and friends. I have had if for more than one year, and it has performed above expectations under all conditions. The 1 minute video feature is great, and was an unexpected bonus (since I didn't know about it when I bought it off Amazon). 

The camera works great with iPhoto and MacOS X. I bought a 512 MB card for it and so far it has been great. Both my father and my father in law have the previous Powershot S400 and they have had no problems with it. I figure at some point I'll have to change the battery, because Lithium-Ions lose 20% capacity per year, but so far it has worked flawlessly.

I am not a professional photographer. I just happen to be a grandson of one. I use a fully manual Canon TX SLR for my work. So far I've shot 5 rolls of this stuff. Every time there has been something wrong with the camera/me/lighting. Every time I got a usable, and sometimes, great print. This film has a huge exposure latitute (you can really screw up and still get an image) When I show these prints to others, they look at me funny and say, &amp;quot;This is ISO 400?&amp;quot; It has REALLY fine grain. And because it's ISO 400, you can use it for almost anything (I got usable prints after shooting a soccer game: My camera was set at ISO 100 and there were light leaks in the camera door). It's a great film, although I'm told the Royal Gold it replaces is still better. Pick up a pack of this and see what you get. You'll be amazed

This camera does everything it says; yes, it's waterproof and I was very uneasy taking a digital camera into the water for the first time!!  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars:  it is as slow as every other digital camera I've owned as far as focusing, multiple flashes, and then actually shooting.  You get your subject's attention and they smile, frozen, as you hold down the shutter release for a good 3 seconds until the shot is taken (in low light.) I was especially intrigued by its "Bright Capture" technology, but it honestly doesn't seem any different in low light than my old Sony U20 2MP tiny little snapshot camera.  Still that same flash-in-the-dark look.  There is a fill-flash low light program mode (among many many others), but the shutter speed sets itself so slow the background becomes a messy worthless blob, even if you hold your breath and try to remain still.  My ideal snapshot camera is portable, durable, quick, easy, and produces excellent results without having to think about your exposure modes.  This camera has 3.5 out of those 5.  It is way portable, very durable, easy, produces OK results but you have to mess with settings if you're not in daylight, and it's not very quick. 
Overall I am very happy with the purchase and will carry it everywhere

I can not find anything negative to say about this camera.  I wanted a small pocket sized camera a tried brands such as Casio's Exislim.  Even though this camera is not as small as the Casio, it is far superior of a camera.  Size why's, it is still small enough to fit in a pocket but is also big enough so that it isn't awkward or difficult to use.  The pictures from this camera turn out spectacular, the 10x zoom is by far the best feauture of this camera.  The lcd screen is also very clear, unlike the Casio and other camera's similar to this one.  You can't go wrong with this camera.  Highly recommended

I bought this for my mother-in-law who is in her 80s and set it up for her.  It's quite easy if you're already computer literate, and the controls are very user friendly as well.  The software could use a few tweaks to make it not look so basic, but for someone like my mother-in-law, it works well.

Wish I had a docking station for my Nikon.

The Philips 8-Inch Digital Picture Frame is an excellent, high-quality device.  Very easy to get it going - the included cable and computer software make it simple to select digital pictures already stored on your computer and copy them onto the device.  No need to mess around with memory cards - although the device accepts those as well if that works best for you.  Everyone who has seen ours loves it.  It looks great and the picture quality and size are excellent

This is a FABULOUS gift for grandparents if you preload the pictures.  Just be aware that the customer support folks are not that knowledgeable, probably since the product is new.  Don't bypass their software to load the pix if you're transferring from your PC to the frame - their software reduces the memory needed for each one. And even though the software for different size frames is labelled the same, it is not compatible and you can only have one version installed on your pc at a time

Looked at a number of cameras including the TZ3, P5000, and a few others.  Nothing compared to the G7 which is the one I ended up going with; IS, 6x lens, incredible quality, etc.

If you want the best camera out there and don't feel like messing with a DSLR, the Canon G7 is in a league of it's own ~ The Benchmark by which all other manufacturers strive towards.

I bought this camera more than half a year ago. My intention was to get a decent camera for images, but then also be able to use it for filming short movies.

I'm very pleased with its performance. In good lighting conditions, colors come out to be amazing. I really really did not expect them to be so vivid and sparkling! In darker conditions, well, it still works fine, not nearly as bad as I expected from some other reviews. Photos might be grainy or not as vivid anymore, but the stuff is still perfectly suitable to show the photos to people.

As about filming, it's terrific. I mean, resolution is great (sth like 848 by 640 or so), better than what one could possibly expect from a regular camera. And the quality is super awesome, looks very neat on computer screen. Respect.

It has to be pointed out that you cannot zoom while filming, but not many cameras out there can do that.

Oh, it's also very small with a gigantic screen and great battery life. A great buy

Installing the software was a piece of cake, using it is quite another matter. The basic introductory instructions are easy enough but after that it seems to require a PhD in mathematic astrophysics to get round all the available toggles, tweaks and options. First attempts? The moon came out real nice, but Saturn was a white blob with no fine detail. Nothing like type of pics that the super-whizzkids proudly display on the Celestron site. Will go back to night school and one day you might see my fine efforts published as well 
(oh - was using it on a classic LX200 in good see'ing conditions - sorry Celestron!

After buying this camera I was pleased for the most part, as the interface is extremely simple and the picture quality is very good. It's a sleek, smooth design with minimal buttons, thus little confusion. There are 3 things, however, that I'm not happy with. One is that it takes double A batteries, and eats them up REALLY fast. The second thing is that there's no secondary viewfinder, just the LCD screen. The LCD screen is large, which is great.. but this is why the battery life is so low. You can't turn the LCD screen off, so batteries go fast. The third and final thing I dislike about it is that there's no AC adaptor, so whenever you plug your camera into the computer or the TV, not using it to take pictures, you have to run it on batteries. That is, unless you somehow find a compatible 3 volt AC plug, which is neither on the Vivitar website, or anywhere else online that I can find made specifically for this camera. I'm a little upset that it came with no adapter, as that would be SO useful for a camera that eats up batteries. I reccomend rechargibles if you're going to get this camera

I've had this camera for a couple of weeks now, it's my 4th digital camera.  I am very happy with the photos I'm able to take, they are truly outstanding.  I'm still learning all of the settings but I'm finding everything to be user-friendly.  I like the way it feels in my hand and I'm pleased with the battery life.  I purchased a 2GB card to replace the one that came with the camera and it's been the perfect size for me.  The video is amazing, I was standing in the upstairs bathroom of our 2 story house and  saw our little one jumping on the trampoline at the far end of our backyard, so I decided to tape it.  Not only was the quality good, the camera picked up the audio, which I never expected!  And I like that you can zoom in or out while you're taping, I wasn't able to do that with my last camera.

I've had no problems downloading the pics or videos to my computer and the prints I've gotten have been great as well

We had a Canon Powershot S50 3 years ago, loved it. So this time when my husband wanted to buy another digital compact camera, we specifically looked for Canons. 

We originally were thinking of getting the SD700,800 or something like that. But after we compared these cameras together in a store near us. We found out SD900 has the finest LCD display, more opitions in control panel... So we came back and bought it from Amazon (our favorite online store). 

We used it in our last trip to Grand Cayon, LV, SF etc. This SD900 takes very good pictures, especially in good lighting conditions. Colors are also smooth and rich. 

The downside, as you may already read from others' reviews, no battery indication, no raw(it's ok, my husband doesn't do much editiing anyway, it will be too much to ask for a campact camera to offer), control panel is sensitive... don't get frustrated if you happened to pressed the wrong button and couldn't figure the way out during the time of shooting. Stich is a great function which comes with, but when in a very bright area, you can not see the stich alignment very well on the LCD screen (I guess it's a common trouble to all digital compact cameras which are relay on LCD dispay).

Overall, it's a wonderful camera, we love it. It's my husband's camera, I uses Canon 350D, but I borrow it from my husband sometimes because it's tiny compares to my 10 lbs "moose" and it takes very good pictures.

At 10mp, this camera takes some of the clearest and visually stunning pictures I have ever taken with a digital camera.  The clarity and detail alone are reason to get this camera. The display, although pooh-poohed by others as too small, is quite large to me. 

The cameras small, lithe design is another selling point.  Nothing bulky about this camera. You can put it in your front pants-pocket if you needed to. 

Do yourself a favor and get this camera.  You won't regret it.

I needed a new camera to replace my very old digital camera, so I ordered this one and could not be happier with it.

It has all kinds of features, including some manual control options like white balance, etc. for those people who like to mess with that stuff (I'm more of an Auto person, myself).  I used it on vacation last month and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of pictures, after taking only a few test shots to get familiar with the camera.  The camera is very easy to use and gives you a basic user manual to get you started, and also a detailed manual to help you find out how everything works on the camera.  The movie mode works good, too.  The colors come out bright and vivid.  The lag time between pictures is minimal, which is one of the main things I hated about my old 1.3mp Panasonic Palmcam, and the 7.1mp makes for some excellent detail in your pictures.  The only bad thing about the camera, in my opinion, is that it doesn't have a movement stabilizer (or whatever it is called), so it can be prone to shaking, especially when you zoom using the digital zoom.  I like that the camera is small and lightweight, but it is not one of those super thin ones that you feel like you could break in half.

Overall, I think this is a GREAT camera, and I don't think you can find a better camera for the price

I have been using this camera quite a bit and am completely happy. It has both point and shoot, and slr features. You can take quick shots or get started with amiture photography. The software was easy to use, easy to set up, and it works well on my Mac. It has the quality the you would expect with the canon name.

I really did some research on digital cameras, even tried out a Sony, but the Canon brand is by far one of the best.  I don't have to do a lot of thinking when snapping a picture with this camera, it does most of the work!  I like to be able to think about the compostion of my photo and not ISO, aperature, and all that jazz.  The settings make it so easy and the color of the photos turn out so true.  The digital zoom is great and will even alert you if the picture will come out blurry.  There are so many features on this camera, too many to list.  I even found a great deal at Best Buy on a 2 gig memory card, I get  over 1,000 photos with a high resolution!  It takes alkaline batteries, but I bought rechargeable ones and one charge lasts a long time.  I am sooo happy with this camera, I take it with me everywhere, even a couple of days to work.

The Canon underwater housings are designed to protect your camera from the elements, whether they are sand, rain, pool, or ocean.  For use on the beach, while snorkeling, or taking shots of your kids in a pool there is little or no need to worry about the buoyancy of your camera housing.  If you free dive or scuba dive you do not want your camera housing floating out of your hands.  These weights are an easy way to adjust the buoyancy of your housing.  The kit comes with four weight plates so you can fine tune your housing's buoyancy.  I prefer a heavier setup and have added an extra plate compared to what was recommended by Canon.  I'm very happy with the setup and they are very easy to use.

I just got my new photo box today.  I was so excited I opened it at work.  Then I took a picture of my wendy's salad just to see how it looked.  The quality of the pictures are excellent(macro mode).  Light is evenly distributed.

Caution about the lights:
The lights get really hot really fast.  Untouchable within 2min. after I turn them on.  I suggest for the shear sanctity of safety, shut off the lights between object/scene changes.

The package arrived intact, the box was beat up a little, nothing major.  When I opened the item, I noticed the Camera stand had pierced the nylon on the bottom.  This could've been a bad/weak stitch, or may have happened during shipping, but nothing major was wrong, only that.  Besides, I can sew it!

Overall, this is a great product, and is easy to setup and carry around.  I'd definitely buy again

I always say that there is technology you can use and technology you can impress others with.
This model helps you do both. You have a nice 5.1 MP still camera and MPEGMovie4TV video.
The very fact that you have a camera which you can take both still pictures and video is huge. I never had a video camera before because I hate to carry two camera and a big camera case, so this was the obvious solution.
I realize that instead of embracing the moment (for which they need the memory) most people often juggle between cameras.
Cons:
* Sometimes people might confuse it with camera phone
* Buttons are harder to find
* Software is not the best
* Wish had more zoom
Pros:
* Convince
* Compact
* Battery lasts long
* Flash is good
* Video sound quality is good
I wonder why this model has not swept the market - another story of good product and mad marketing

We bought this bag for our Panasonic PV-GS400 video camera, this bag is just the perfect size, we can fit our PV-GS400, tapes, extra batteries, recharger, video cables, remote control, and even a small tripod. Has different comparments. On top of functionality is done with a very high quality. I highly recommend it, just check your camera dimensions and compare with the bag before you buy

I bought my K10D in Dec 06 after owning a number of Pentax cameras over the years and being very pleased with the engineering. The combination of features, if executed properly, make this camera the best buy in 10MP DSLRs right now.  I postponed my review because I wanted to get some real field experience.  I just went to Mexico, and panicked because I left the camera instruction manual behind.  I can now report on that trip. I did a little fumbling at first, mainly because I didn't have the manual, but I was soon able to find the combinations I wanted, and the camera performed both flexibly and intuitively.  The AF button and the exposure compensation button are very well placed.  I found myself in difficult lighting situations often, and both AF and exposure metering worked quite well.  I also took some hand-held shots that I normally would use a tripod with (such as at 450mm), and very few came out fuzzy because of camera movement.  In a few cases, I used bracketing, and was easily able to obtain a good balance of details in one or more of the bracketed shots.  Exposure metering worked so well that I stopped bracketing.  I particularly liked the display modes: I could boost the brightness to see the display even in bright daylight, and deep zooming gave me a good check of whether a shot was "soft" or not right at the scene.  The rechargeable Li Ion batteries, although not readily available in stores, seem to last forever (even using power zoom, and full-bright display, and some fill flash).  I believe that I could have shot all week (700 shots in RAW (DNG) + JPEG) with the battery grip attached. In summary, this camera was a pleasure to hold, very easy to use and manipulate, and resulted in a high percentage of crisp photos (even if the percentage of well-composed shots was lower because of the photographer).  I bought it because of its compatibility with Pentax lenses, 10MP sensor, shake-reduction technology, larger display, and especially the dust and water seals.  But what makes me quite happy about it is its overall ease of use and good results.  I am still discovering its features, but I already know that this camera frees me to be creative in ways that other cameras have not in the past.  Some of the features on this camera are unique (new program lines) and some are available only on cameras costing several hundred dollars more, making the K10D a good choice and a best buy.  Once again for Pentax, the engineering is supurb.

This scope is one of the best Gen 1 units on the market. At 36 lines/mm, it has just about the best resolution. Most other units only have 24 lines/mm. The illuminator is bright (almost too bright), uniform, and has a crisp edge. It could be a bit larger, however, so that it would fill the field of view.

Note that if you remove the eyepiece or lens, (to put on the riflescope eyepiece or change the magnification) you will break the seal and the unit will no longer be waterproof.

Don't bother with the IR flashlight. It's output is actually less than the built-in illuminator and it is far from uniform.

Yes, I am slow to make this review, maybe because I spend a great deal of time using this camera.
The ONLY thing I would like to have changed, is a rechargable pack.  At first I burned thru many batteries.  I switched to rechargables, and find that I still use a great deal of power, (I shoot often with the flash,) but now I can recharge the spent batteries after each session.  I use the charge of 12 AA's in a 3 hour shoot.
I use this camera for studio work and it has served me well for a good number of years already

A little background first...

This was an upgrade camera for me, just over a year ago.  I was in 35mm format for over 20 years.  I used a Pentax K1000 body and several different lenses, tele-converters and filters.  At work, I've had 4 years experience with a Fuji Fine Pix 2MP "point-and-shoot".  It was provided by my work and was very durable (it had to be, as I am in Construction Engineering).  When I decided to switch "personally" to all digital I was very cautious.

I first looked for pic quality and durability.  From an "advanced-amature" photographer's point of view, this camera is great !!!

This camera never leaves my side.
It travels with me everywhere I go.
It is extremely durable as it is mounted to an "Ultra-Pod II" and I carry it over my shoulder (I don't keep it in a bag).
It provides me OUTSTANDING QUALITY POHOTGRAPHS (close, far or fast: work or play) at a very reasonable price.
It takes reasonable video (considering my 35mm took none at all).
It is easy to use and learn (even for an old 35mm guy).
It is lightweight and power usage is not an issue (NiMH is the way to go).

I take close to 20,000 pics a year for work and play.  I am always experimenting with this camera and it's limits.  I am so pleased with this camera (and the previous Fuji I used) that my next upgrade will be a Fuji as well (looking to 10MP).

For the $$$ you can't go wrong

Having been engaged in 35mm photography for 32 years, I approached digital photography with great reluctance.  I knew there would be an essential learning phase with less than ideal pictures, like my playing with a brownie for a few years as a kid -- this further delayed my plunge.  Finally, an upcoming trip overseas compounded with the knowledge of what airport metal detectors do to film forced the issue.

My choice was cinched by some pictures we acquired from a friend of papal conclave 2006.  We ran them as a screen saver, and I was much impressed by the sharpness, color tonality, and depth of field -- especially in cloudy day pictures of crowds in public squares.  Faces far into the background were discernable.  I asked what was used and it was this camera.  At the camera store I was heartened to see it felt like a mini SLR in the hand, had a nice big viewer and uncomplicated, straightforward controls.

The learning phase in the backyard and around town gave me some doubts.  Lack of no-shake feature is the model's biggest downside; a lot got blurred especially using the zoom feature on moving subjects.  Some of this you learn to shake out using point focus, but you still are going to lose a few  precious moments despite your best efforts.  Nor with the limited equivalent ASA range are you going to be able to get the sort of pics in museums or dark old cathedrals you are used to with a good SLR and high speed film -- but remember, this one is a starter.  This thing is a monster battery eater, too:  always carry 2 fully charged replacement sets with you.  On the plus side, choice of black and white and chrome mode is very nice feature, and the built-in zoom has a very decent range and performance on stationary subjects.  Speed of use may or may not compare well to other digitals, I don't know, but its a whole world superior to my old world.  There is a rather steely patina to even the best color images, I see now after viewing hundreds, but that's a decent trade-off for the general ease of use and clarity.  Incidentally, the lens on this camera gives you a lot more than what you would expect from a 4 megapixel rating.

Back from Europe this week, I have 2000+ jpegs (the keepers) all of very high quality, an achievement I could not have come close to, I am sure, either with old film camera or with most other starter level digitals.  The continuing issue of shake and blur I surmounted by simply multiple shooting a lot (sometimes 5-7 images); you can erase them almost as quickly as you shoot them, and come to see this as a small nuisance in the bigger trade-off.  

I do not plan to spend the rest of my life with this level digital camera, but even after I move up I think I will keep it around for sheer utilty and ease of use in the general every day world.  For the price, this is about as good a deal as one can hope for.

With most of the carrying case made of either fake leather or some kind of neoprene material, this one is really different.  The rigid structure also seem to do a great job to protect the camera.  There is also a belt loop and D-ring feature which is great.

It's easy to use and makes good pictures, easily a match for the disposable cameras that require you to turn the camera in and wait. I also have a 1GB san card so I can shoot up to almost 1400 pictures. As it is I shoot a couple and then load them into my laptop and send them to people via e-mail

Got this camera because a friend had a similar one. The blue tooth feature is just great. You need a memory card to make if you want to take video's and store a lot of photos. The video's are not bad and pretty remarkable for a camera this size. All in all a great buy

The camera is great because it is small enough to slip into your pocket and take wherever.  I have been the main picture taker on our family vacations and get-togethers.  We had a 10X optical, 5 MP kodak camera that worked well, it was just big and bulky, never to fit in a pocket.  The 10X optical zoom on the V610 also works well, the lenses never protrude from the camera when I use the optical zoom.  The viewing screen is large and very clear.  The menus are very easy to navigate and the on camera editing tools are great.  It would also make a fine camera for a beginner.  The panorama function works very well also.  I have used it multiple times with ease and it created great pictures. The camera turns on quickly and the time between pressing the button and the photo capture is quick.  I have had the camera for about a month now and the best thing is the small size without having to compromise in zoom, picture quality, or functionality.  The LCD screen does take up some more battery than other cameras just because it is larger, but don't let that stop you from getting the camera.  You will be able to take at least 70 or so pictures on a battery and a lot more if you are conservative.  My only small frustration was when going skiing, I attempted to video my brother coming down the slope using the 10X optical zoom and the image stabilizer.  It was at night and only the lights were on, the camera wouldn't focus on him until he was close, but that may be just because of the low light conditions and glare from the snow. Otherwise the video has worked flawlessly.  There is even a terrific function that allows you to pause the video at any time during playback and create a picture from that video frame. (Very useful)  My brother bought the Panasonic Lumix? DMC-TZ1K,(a very good camera also) before i got the V610 and now he wishes he got the V610

This just arrived Thursday so these comments come with minimal time on camera so far. I am also absolutely an amateur user of camcorders so I won't be able to comment on the quality of the manual controls, etc.

I agree closely with the other two reviews so I won't repeat their details. I'll try to hit a few other topics and also compare the HC7 to the Sony HC90, an earlier model that took 16:9 standard definition video with 3 MP stills.

I have taken about one hour of HD video so far, and have viewed it through an HDMI cable on a Sony 46" XBR LCD TV (1080p). I captured a few indoor scenes, a few neighborhood outdoor scenes, and some footage at Harper's Ferry in West Virginia - river, mountain, and two trains passing by at close range while I was at the railroad station there. I can say comfortably that you won't confuse the video from this camcorder with Standard Definition camcorder video - when they say High Definition, they aren't kidding.  If your TV can show the video off to advantage and you've grown fond of HD, I think you'd be pleased with this camcorder.  In my case, the overwhelming reason I upgraded camcorders was to get the HD video, so this has made it worth the steep expense. My second requirement is to have a camcorder that took decent stills so I only have to carry one piece of equipment around. I already had this in the Sony HC90 at 3MP, so going up to 6MP was desirable but not enough to make me buy something this expensive in itself.

My only output criticisms so far are that the West Virginia footage looks a little brighter and the water a little greener than I remember. I didn't play with any settings so take that with a grain of salt. These camcorders have a lot of manual adjustments you can make which I have not explored. One or more of them undoubtedly would have given me improved footage, and I'm not unhappy with what I think I noticed in the slightest.

The stills look very good to me so far, but I've only taken about 20 and viewed them on the TV. I normally view stills on a PC.

I don't have a telephoto lens yet so I can't report on the quality of the stabilization. I used a tripod today and that was readily apparent in the stability of the video.  I was very pleased, by the way, with how well the camera did with the moving trains. Very crisp where I expected a fair bit of motion blur.

LCD size and controls have been mentioned in First Looks. I'm perfectly happy with a 2.7" LCD instead of the larger one in the UX7. So this wasn't a negative for me personally. The controls (menus) are highly similar to those of the Sony HC90 I already have. If you haven't seen them before, there's a learning curve. If you have the HC90 or another camcorder with those menus, you'll be right at home with the HC7. One note: you can configure P[ersonal]-Menus to include the things you use the most in your own order, in addition to the camcorder's menus. One thing I forgot is that each mode (video, camera, play/edit) has its own configurable personal menu. So I was looking for things to add to the Play/Edit personal menu that I was sure should be configurable, but couldn't find them. That was because they belonged only to the filming side, not to the playback side. So you've got three personal menus you can create, not one.

Battery: check the sizes on the batteries. The HC90 batteries were very thin. I think three of the batteries for the HC7 fit entirely within its case. The fourth and largest battery looked to be much bigger in one dimension such that I thought it would extend past the end of the camera 1/2" or so. The other three will fit flush into the back of the camera, though they're not behind a door or anything.

Battery life: my impression so far is that the battery life statements are accurate, but the batteries drain faster than that of the HC90. This is almost certainly a function of increased power load instead of the older batteries being better than the newer ones.  The CCDs and the stills and everything are all "more" than in the HC90. So I think I'm fine with the battery life, but you'll need to watch it and definitely have more than one battery.

Size compared to the HC90: this struck me as being about 10-15% bigger overall than the HC90. It's maybe 1/2" longer front to back, and wider as well. I think the HC7 is one notch up in size from the average camcorder I see in Best Buy. But it's noticeably smaller than last year's SR1 Sony hard disk camcorder, say. I don't see dropping this one in a coat pocket like I did with the HC90, but it's pretty light and still fits in the case I used for the HC90 if I don't load other stuff in there.

Fit in the hand: I found a Best Buy with an HC5 and UX5 on hand and played with both at the same time. These have the same footprint as the HC7 and UX7 as far as I can tell. The HC5's tape case is maybe 3/8" wider than the UX5's DVD case.  The UX5's DVD case is maybe 1/4" higher. So I found that my right-hand fingers curled nicely around the smaller but taller UX5 and it felt slightly more comfortable. However, I found that the HC5's extra width made me curl my palm slightly such that the base of the camcorder fit solidly on top of the ball of my thumb. As I played with this in the store, I realized it seemed like the HC5 actually was easier to hold stable because of this. Absolutely try these two out on your own instead of assuming this will be true for you. Just wanted to say that the two cases do differ a bit and will probably feel different to you at some level.

Tape vs DVD (really HDV vs AVCHD): I spent a lot of time wondering if the noise reported in last year's AVCHD UX camcorders would still be present, and if I would care in any case. The detailed reviews still aren't out, so I don't know whether there will be a noise problem there. But I can say I noticed nothing in the footage so far that I'd call noise, so my decision to go with the tape and HDV format looks very good to me right now. I have never had the problems people report with Mini-DV tapes, so that whole transport discussion (tape vs DVD) didn't weigh on me much. The noise discussion did have an effect on my decision, though.

Getting the video to your TV: "how much money do we have?", apparently. I played the tape back to the TV directly, but that's not a long-term solution. I have heard that you can capture the HDV video and then will be able to transform it on a PC to formats suitable for Blu-Ray or HDV burners, if you have the money. Then you need a Blu-Ray or HDV player attached to your TV. For now, it sounds like many people are archiving the HDV video to DVDs as data files. Then they burn playable DVDs where the HD is down-converted to standard definition video.  So they get to see decent versions of the video now and can produce HD versions for playback in the future as technology changes and prices drop.  One other HC7 reviewer also implied that HD files captured by Ulead software could be moved to a PS3 hard drive and played back to an HD TV from there. So far, the easy and cheap path we have for SD video to DVDs to TVs is not quite there for HD based on what I've read. 

The one extra feature I wish the camcorder had was a built-in 20X optical zoom. I'm sure this would affect both the cost and the size of the barrel negatively, so I "understand". But that would be #1 on my wish list.

Overall, I am amazed at what camcorder manufacturers can pack into these shells now.  I know we're talking computers that are way more powerful at image processing than anything that existed ten years ago.  But it is still almost like magic to drag a camcorder of this size around, take some video, and then have play it back on a high-quality HD TV looking to me like it was taken with broadcast-level equipment. I know better intellectually, but it's really great to have a camcorder like this that marries up with the new TVs so beautifully.

I am totally satisfied with Product features. For me still it's  better than any available product from other company in this segment.
I ranked this product 4 because it manual dial malfunction very often. If I select Album mode it still thinks to be in SnapShot mode and vice-versa. It's out of guarantee and I'll hv to live with it.
Anyway there are many products present in market in this series to go with like W50 or something like that

After owning and using the camera for a month or so now, I am delighted with it.  I have only replaced the batteries one time, so don't know what the review hullabuloo about that was for.  small lightweight, many features.  choice of 6 meg, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 meg photos at fingertips.  What I really decided on this camera for was the MACRO capability as I take photos of very small coins, and must be able to get in within an inch or two to do that.  It preforms magnificantly.  My previous camera had to add additional lens to do this which was a hassle.  I love the Samsung digimax S600.

Wow..Okay so I was thinking this was a screen about the size of a smaller camera because I didnt read the dimensions before I bought it here on amazon so i was a little disappointed in the size. this is about HALF the size of an ipod mini. It is by no means big . read the dimesions well before you purchase. 

The photos are really good quality and clear ..just small lol.

Okay, I am new to the world of stargazing.  I purchased this telescope based on recommendations here at Amazon.com.  I have been completely satisfied.  I am especially impressed with the clear, crisp viewing of the moon.  I can see a few planets, but they are of course very small through the eyepiece.

I do have a suggestion to anyone who may purchase this telescope.  Take your time putting it together.  Read all the directions first.  Pay special attention to the details concerning the Collimator.  If you don't know what that is, you need to.  I almsot made some major mistakes, screwing and unscrewing parts that needed to be left alone.  

If you pay attention to all of the details on the instructions, you will have the telescope together in a couple of hours and be well on your way to enjoying yourself, especially on a clear night.

The package containing my telescope arrived in four days and was completely intact.  I couldn't be happier with my purchase.  I am sure a more avid sky-watcher might want a little something more, but for the once-in-a-while gazer, this is the telescope.

See ya next review.

I needed an extra battery.  This whole kit was cheaper than the price of the battery alone.  In addition to the battery, you get a standard camera case (Retail $10-20) and a very nice shoulder bag intended to carry 2 cameras, accessories, and the portable Canon printer.  There is absolutely nothing not to like about this deal

I bought one of these items in December '04 from Adorama.  It had directions written in raised letters on the canister itself.  I just ordered here and received a second one in March '07 and the "new" model has no instructions.  Other than that, it looks identical to the old one, so I assume the contents are the same.
Here are the exact words written on the old one:
"HYDROSORBENT 40 GRAM SILICA GEL"
"WHEN PINK, REACTIVATE 3 HOURS AT 300F"
The pink referred to is the little circle in the center of the canister.

I keep this product with my camera (in closed stuff sack) and it seems to work as advertised - though I guess you just have to have faith that it does - no easy way to prove it (except maybe in extremely humid climes)

For those wishing to purchase this product, and who also want accessory filters to protect the lens, or to add special effects, although not mentioned, the size of the filter is 30mm. (NOT the 37 mm mentioned at other locations, which caused me to order the wrong size which now must be returned.)

Remember, 30 (thirty) mm

To my knowlege, there simply isn't a better equipped camera for the professional investigator.  It's IR-sensitive mode (nightshot) is in B&amp;W (rather than cheeseygreen), far superior quality-wise to anything Sony's got, and it's the only 3CCD that I know of with a low-light mode.  The image stabilization is exceptional and the image quality is production grade.  Time/Date stamps can be "burned in" so they xfer via firewire - again, the only camera I'm aware of with this feature.  The audio can be turned off which we know is a must.  And best yet, you can disable the sleepmode so it won't turn off eliminating missed money shots waiting for the camera to cycle back on.  It's built like a tank and feels substantial in the hand, but it's still lightweight thanks to an alloy frame.  Finally, it's totally silent even with the tape transport in full swing.  

The ONLY downside so far as I can tell is it's size - It's a big camera compared to the handicams I've had, and wouldn't be well suited for close-proximity work.  However, the black casing dosn't print/siloutte terribly, and the 16x optical lets you set back quite a bit.

Highly recommended!

I'm by no means an expert, but I really wanted a reasonably priced video camera that could produce the highest quality picture for the price.  I did a TON of research and landed on the AG-DVC30 after much agonizing over "to HD or not HD" as well as brands and features.  Based on all the reviews I read, this camera seemed to offer the most features and the best video for the money.  I have not been disappointed.  On my first outing, I took the cam to the Grand Canyon and Sedona.  Wow!  What incredible color and clarity!  I also really love the 16x zoom.  It's smooth and powerful.  I got great shots of the Colorado River from the rim of the Grand Canyon.  I'll agree with all reviewers that the audio is not great.  It is not super sensitive so you lose sound if not quite close to the subject.  If you're interested in good audio, I'd suggest an optional mic.  If you just want great video, awesome color, and ease of use, this is your camera.  At the price (plus the rebate) you really can't beat it

I bought these Binoculars for my Dad for Christmas, and he is absolutely in love with them.  The distance it can handle is slightly above average, but the clarity is really where this thing shines.  Its very easy to use, and has held up reasonably well.  I would recomend it to the casual user

This digital photo frame has reasonably good picture quality and once set up, can be used by anyone in the selected mode.  I have it set for slide presentation mode and people enjoy looking at it.  I could easily see giving it, already set up, to people who are not computer savvy, such as grandparents.  To give them new pictures, send a new card and they slip that in.  That said, the cost is still fairly high and the buttons on the top of the frame useless unless you have them memorized or really good vision.  I would recommend this product

We got this camcorder for our daughter for her birthday and she loves it! Her only problem with it is that a memory card is needed because there isn't as much space as she would like and alot of light is needed to film. We were aware of both of these complaints when we purchased it but we were certain that she could work around them. We were also aware of the battery problem, so she got rechargeable batteries. Awesome little camcorder, especially for the price

I RECENTLY RECIEVED MY NEW CAMERA, AND I AM THRILLED.  I HAVE BEEN RESEARCHING WHICH CAMERA TO BUY SINCE DECEMBER (WHEN OUR LAST CAMERA WENT CAPOOT).  THERE HAVE BEEN MIXED REVIEWS FOR THE OLYMPUS SW SERIES, BUT COULD NOT RESIST THE APPEAL OF THIS CAMERA'S UNIQUE FEATURES.  I CANNOT WAIT TO TAKE IT INTO THE POOL THIS SUMMER WITH THE KIDS.  SO FAR, THE POINT AND SHOOT OPTIONS AND PICTURES HAVE BEEN LOVELY.  ANY PERSON CAN SCREW UP PICTURES WITH ANY CAMERA, BUT THIS CAMERA HAS SO MANY FEATURES TO AVOID THAT.  MY HUSBAND AND I HAD A WONDERFUL TIME TAKING EXTREME CLOSE UP SHOTS OF OUR GARDEN.  I HAVE NOT SEEN THAT QUALITY, AND HAD THAT MUCH SATISFACTION FROM A CAMERA SINCE WE FIRST SWITCHED OVER TO DIGITAL.  I AM VERY PLEASED, TO SAY THE LEAST, WITH THIS PURCHASE.

If you are expecting clear professional sound transmission, this is not it.  That's a wireless system costing $1,000 - $3,000.  This  system is strictly for home none professional use.  I think people were expecting this system to deliver the hi fidelity sound they hear on movies or TV soundtrack.  Professionals do not use this system.  That is the reason for the low price.  Home movies only.

This product is so cool.  Whatever your situation is, if you have a lot of digital pictures, then I recommend going out and getting an SD card...preferably up to 1GB (or even 512MB), for use this with this product.  Even if your camera doesn't use SD, you can plop the SD card right into the picture frame and upload photos from your computer TO the card!  It's like a little computer, this frame.  Another big suggestion I have is to find a program online that resizes your photos to the dimensions of the frame (photo size explained in other reviews). (I downloaded Visualizer Photo Resize).  This will take photos down from its original size (e.g. 1.8 MB) to a smaller size (e.g. 500KB).  This will let your store dramatically more photos.  So far I have fit over 1700 photos in about 430MB worth of the 1GB SD card that I have!  The picture quality is very good and the frame can swivel to basically any angle and could be used horizontally or vertically.  Plus, it is a Philips, which is a great brand.  I have a Philips HD TV as well and it is my baby...I love it.  This is a great present for anyone!  How can you go wrong with a picture frame that replaces its picture any time you want

Picked up a Bushnell Yardage Pro 1000 Laser Rangefinder used online at another site for alittle less than half the new price.
Works very good and was worth every penny I spent on it. Easily ranged objects and animals well past 800 yards.

This can be used in lieu of a replacement battery.  Plus if an electrical outlet is convienent, like when shooting inside, you never have to worry about running out of power.  Also handy if you are mobile and have a auto dc/ac converter.  But not as overall convienent as an extra battery.  I thought it would also trickle recharge the battery, but it doesn't.  Nikon should add this feature in

I had an Olympus Stylus 4MP and loved it but wanted a newer model.  I purchased this 710 and love it.  Olympus makes it so easy to take pictures with pre-set options and image stabilization.  I love the smaller size of this camera and it was easy to use.  There is no way to give it 4 1/2 stars so I gave it 5 but there is one thing I don't like about the area for the USB plug in. You have to pop off this cap (it hangs off the camera) and maneuver the small end of the cable in the camera (tight fit with the cap hanging there) then pop the cap back on..it just seems flimsy and I wonder if that cap will eventually break off.  In the 410 it was much easier to access this as it was near the memory card.  That is the only design feature I don't care for on the 710.  It is a great camera and I am very happy with the purchase.

An excellent purchase that lives up to the Sony name. My main concern before buying it was that it would swivel enough that I could point my mini-camera straight down to take macro photos of documents. It does this easily, and the legs don't get in the way. It's small enough to chuck in my backpack and take it all the time in case I need it, and it has its own little sturdy fabric carrying bag so that it doesn't get tangled up in anything else. Overall, I would rate it as excellent

Picked mine up used on eBay for $180.  With the growth of the VR market everyone is dumping there old lenses.  You can get a used one for a great price.  This lens is great for the serious amatuer.

I have taken some incredible pictures with this lens.  The autofocus is a little slow and I have heard people complain about softness on the high end but I have a photo blown up to 20 x 17 taken from my D70 at 300mm.  Of course I shoot the photo on a tripod.... I have not experienced the softnes

Go to Nikon's own website NikonUSA.com and compare the technical specifications of this version and the 'G' version of this lens.  There are only three differences.  One is that the 'G' version has its aperture set only by the camera body, while the 'D' version can have its aperture set either by the body or by a ring on the lens.  All recent Nikon bodies set the aperture.  The ring on the lens is invariably locked on all recent camera bodies.  The second difference is that one (1) of the 13 lens elements in the D version of the lens is made of Extra Low Dispersion (ED) glass.  If the dispersion difference is so important what is the deal with the other 12 elements?  Sounds like marketing to me.  The third difference is that the 'D' version costs three times as much as the 'G' version

These binoculars provide a good tool for night time
sky viewing.  Easier to carry than a telescope with
the advantage of using both eyes.  The tripod mount
can be used with most any tripod with a standard screw mount.
The 15 power makes hand holding a challenge but with practice
they work great.

The binoculars were suprisingly lightweight for their size and power.
The 70mm lens were great at light gathering, and the 4.75 mm exit pupil
provide more light than most adults can use.  (The avg. is 3-4 mm)
With a good strap is easy to wear for long periods and excellent for long distance terrestrial viewing or general astromical use.  You really need a tripod to use the full power effectively, but for short periods those with steady hands can enjoy the binocs on the fly

Bought these batteries &amp; charger just before going on an overseas trip.  I didn't want to be bothered with frequently changing AA batteries, which seemed to last only a day or so of heavy use.  I was quite pleased with the performance of these rechargeables.  They lasted several days of heavy use before needing to be charged and they re-charged in only a few hours.  A big bonus that I didn't expect:  the recharger is compatible with European 240 voltage so I didn't have to use an electric converter!

I bought this together with the Sony Alpha (very good deal from Amazon). The lens is a great complement to the kit lens or the identical but older KM 18-70. Images are very sharp and the lens is built very well. Great for wildlife imaging. The other reviewers are right; the AF isn't too good at the long end of this lens but overall a great camera.
The end of the lens DOES ROTATE while zooming. It may not be good for some filters

This is a great camera for travel and everyday events because of its small and convenient size.  We bought it to replace our bulkier Sony DSC-F707.  The large screen is wonderful!  The video feature is a lot of fun but due to the small size it is hard to take a steady video.  The battery meter is very useful as it tells you how much time you have left.  The main downside with this camera is the flash.  It doesn't work well in very dark conditions for distant or even slightly distant shots.  If it weren't for the flash, I would have given this a rating of 5 stars.  This is overall a good camera.

For more serious digital photography, we prefer to use the Sony DSC-F707 as it has a better flash and zoom.  However, it is too bulky to carry around

We purchased this camera as a replacement for our bulky Sony DSC-P52, which stopped working after year or so due to a problem with the lens mechanism. Naturally, only time will tell if this is any different, but in the meantime, here's what you need to know about this baby:

The Good:

1) Size and weight - Fits almost comfortably in any pocket. Much thinner and lighter than any previous digital camera I've owned, thus encourages one to carry it most anywhere. The size is also pretty comfortable for one-hand shooting.

2) Big LCD screen - You didn't need me to tell you this, right? Makes previewing images and taking shots much more satisfying, though sometimes it does not appear very clear, especially if the subject is not static. However, it is bright and rich in color.

3) InfoLithium - This is Sony's name for a battery that tells you how much time it has left - only approximately, of course. If use is consistent, will provide you with a good idea. If you use one function then another then another, it tends to vary much more and is not as useful. 

4) Integrated charger/USB station - A flimsy plastic cradle takes care of charging the on-board battery as well as providing a USB hookup for downloading images and video into the computer. Minimizes wires and removes the need for a separate charger, though the bright white color is far from a match.

The Bad:

1) Focusing problems - The camera cannot focus on objects that are relatively close to it. I am not speaking about macros, but simply the function - or lack thereof - to focus on small, near objects, such as coins, stamps, or text. Quick focus on objects farther away, though.

2) Integrated Battery - I listed the InfoLithium as a positive, but the fact that you cannot just pop-in a couple of AA batteries means you will always need the station or the plug to charge up if you need some juice. I don't know if the battery is universal, but even if it is, it will cost substantially more to purchase a replacement.

3) Incompatible Memory Sticks - I will not complain about Sony's desire to make consumers pay more for its cards than adopting a standard, but this camera uses the MemoryStick Duo, which is about 1/4 or so smaller than the "regular" MemoryStick. This means that the hundreds you may have invested in memory cards for previous Sony digital cameras are pretty useless, as they do not fit into this or any other device using the smaller cards.

4) Ineffective Flash - The flash is tiny, thus does not provide adequate illumination in the dark. Within a few feet is okay, but farther subjects are not touched.

5) 3x Optical Zoom - C'mon, this is 2005! 3x optical zoom is pretty pathetic for such an expensive camera.

6) Slow Write Speed - There is a decent pause between pictures, meaning you not be able to shoot at a rapid rate. You can certainly take pictures in bursts, but it takes even longer to write to the memory stick. Previewing the images is also slow. This is also disappointing, as it's not faster than my older P52.

7) No Tripod Hookup - If you wish to use a tripod, you have to mount the camera on the plastic station, then connect the tripod to the plastic dock. This is far from ideal.

Well, there you have it. The negatives I listed may be insignificant for you, in which case this could be a great value for you. I am certainly happy with it, but I only wish Sony would stop treating its customers like cash cows with changing standards, compatibilities, and dubious long-term quality

I've owned the T9 now for just about 3 weeks.  I purchased it after some extensive research.  Of course you never really know a product until you've had it awhile.  Here's my thumb nail opinion.
I like:
The ultra thin metal body
Optical image stabilizer
great photo quality
high ISO performance
large, high rez screen
Auto focus assist lamp works well
very fast start-up
fast recovery even after flash
lots of built in memory, but you need to buy the 1 or 2 gig card
ok slide show feature with music

I don't like:
Redeye doesn't work that well
Too few manual controls
needs white balance
needs long shutter speed modes
Chews up battery time pretty fast. Already ordered a second battery.
No optical viewfinder (most ultra smalls don't)
flimsy plastic cover over the battery will be first thing to break

All in all a great little camera.  Takes awesome, clear pics.  Not for the professional photographer, but that's not why you are considering it (I hope).

Very compact, light and easy to hold - full marks for design. Buttons etc can take a bit of getting used to, but ok once mastered. Main downside for me it only takes DVD-R/RW- and not DVD-R/RW+, bit of a problem when you pick up the wrong ones! Also, can be a problem taking it abroad - I had issues charging it as it would take a standard US to UK converter plug as the pins are slightly wider than normal US plugs.

This is the only tripod that I have ever owned, however, I do agree that it seems to be a very nice piece of equipment, especially for the very low price. It suits my needs well for a small digital camera. The only downside is that it does not come with a carry bag. This was an oversight on my part when I ordered, and I'm sure I would have to pay just as much as I did for the tripod to get a bag for it, so I will live with it as is

  The Panasonic PV-GS500 was discontinued in late 2006 in anticipation of Panasonic's new 2007 models which will be available in the Spring.

  The PV-GS500 is compact, delivers stunning video in moderate lighting and above, has a lot of features that will appeal to the aspiring pro-sumer videographer. It lacks an audio output jack, which many will fault it for. It does have a separate microphone jack. The menu is driven by a toggle and is easy to use.

  It is reall aimed at the casual videographer who wants superb quality in a compact, uncomplicated package and it delivers precisely that.

  Low-light performance is poor, but there is an accessory shoe, so you can mount an auxillary light. I would suggest getting an accessory bracket that provides two or three accessory shoes so you can use both a shotgun microphone and an auxillary light for weddings, parties and other group events.

  Battery life is about what you would expect, so carrying one or two spare batteries is recommended.

  All in all, a very nice 3CCD camcorder for the advanced amateur or just someone who wants superb image quality in an easy-to-use package.

Of course, it had to be Kodak. No matter what people say, i have always and will always use a kodak digital camera, I've found this camera to be a real warrior, last one I had lasted about 4 year and this one looks even better, Photo cuality its very good and colors are great, no excesive blue or red in your pics, Night photo taking its excelent in close shots.

4 stars beacuse its really a batterie eater, but its nothing a 25$ batterie charger can`t solve. 

Sorry for grammar mistakes but english is not my natal lenguaje

I bought this camera to replace a 3MP Kodak CX series when I thought I had lost it.  My 3MP took great pics and I never had any problems with it and I didn't want to have to learn to use a different brands software.

The Kodak easyshare software didn't impress me much when I bought the first camera but they have made some improvements and the updated version is much better.  The Kodak gallery is a nice option that allows you to share pics without sending large email files.

I haven't used the C533 a lot since I bought it but the pics I've taken have come out great. But just like the other reviews state, slow shutter speed at low light and it does like batteries.  However, if you spend the extra money for the Lithium batteries you'll get much improved battery life.

All in all a great value and a perfect camera for a point and shoot person

Worked like a charm in my Panasonic AG-DV30 video camera!  Having 5+ hours of battery life really helps when you're on vacation and don't want to mess with charging batteries or being "selective" in your shooting.  This gives you the freedom to tape what you want and edit out the boring stuff later.  Worth the money and a good deal here

    I purchased this camera as a replacement for Canon Optura 20 which was dropped and when estimate for repair exceeded price of this camera, I decided to move on. After using DCR-HC28 for several weeks, I believe this is a very neat package. Overall, I am very satisfied with this camera. One of the first things that I noticed is that color representation in low light conditions is much more accurate than that of Canon. I grew accustomed to adjusting Optura's white balance indoor in order to get accurate color tones. Now I am finding, that automatic settings work just fine and, in fact, I didn't have a reason to play with presets as of yet. This camera is more of a "point and shoot" type than Canon. It provides you with manual controls, but they are not easily accessible. Still, I have not found a reason to mess with these. Besides, for those, who would claim that manual settings are necessary for advanced/professional type of filming, I would point to the price tag and ask where and when did they last see an advanced/professional camera for under $300? 
    This camera is also about half the size of Canon and combined with low price and weight, produces a package that I can drag with me while going to the beach, bicycling, hiking, etc and not having to worry about ruining expensive piece of electronic gear, as was the case with my Optura which, at the time when I bought it, cost me about 2.5 times of what I paid for Sony.
    So far, I've used this camera in about all of the lighting conditions that I would expect to ever having to consider. I have NO COMPLAINTS about its performance. Picture seems to be sharply focused and color tones are correct. Focus is fast enough to keep up with little kids or to shoot some sports/action. Sound quality of the microphone is quiet acceptable. There seems to be very little noise from drive motor and it is not picked up by the mic so it is not transferred to your recording. All of the essential controls and menus are within easy reach.
    There are few negative points that prevent me from giving this camera 5-star rating. Lack of any kind of accessory shoe or external microphone input is a drawback. It would be nice to have these, as it would increase range of conditions under which one can use it. Still, among my friends, who actually have a camcorder, about 90% don't own an accessory light or external microphone, so if it was possible to lower camera cost by omitting these features, it is not a criminal move on part of Sony. The LCD display could have been a bit larger and it would not hurt if Sony would provide it with more freedom of motion - it only swings out to 90 degree angle and in certain situations it is a limiting factor.

What I love about this case is its softness and its superior quality. It fits just like a glove and it protects the camera at the time it never poses a danger to it. (I have had other older cases that scratched or even crushed the cameras). This one seems to be an improved model. 
It does not need to have handles because you are supposed to use the strap on the camera. Highly recommendable

  I bought this dock from a seller called Miga.  They did an excellent job of answering my questions on the product and sending everything in mint condition.  I use the dock for my HP R817.  Having read the reviews regarding the insert I just went through HP's part site and ordered the correct insert for my camera.  It was only $5 (before shipping) and it arrived the same day as the dock package.  The dock transfers data so much faster then the cradle that comes with the camera plus it has an extra battery which would cost $50 and up by itself from HP.  I bought the dock for its dual charging ability for when I go on trips since this dock is less expensive then the fast charge travel kit.  I probably won't use the remote control feature or print images right from the dock.  But for what I will use it for its an excellent product for the price and I highly recommend it for you 817 818 users out there.

Buy this cable through amazon and you won't be sorry. I looked all over the internet and its sometimes hard to find a good company online to buy through and after the manufacture was sold out these cables , a friend told me about amazon , I typed in the cable number and amazon had it in stock . I decided to order this and hope for the best well sure enough the cable arrived on time just like amazon said . I know have a great working usb cable for my digital camera . I order three since all my friends and family always ask to borrow mine and the fact that I need a replacement. If I had the money I would buy five of these. Its the fact that me, my family, and friends are always misplacing are cables or losing them. So I order this cable through amazon. Its nice to know if I lose my cables I can buy more. Ever since I bought these cables I have been making sure I know where I put em. Be Happy  and buy with no worries

THANK YOU

I originally bought the Edit 120 (no detachable case) but was looking for a separate bag in which to keep the cables that are not used often (to leave at home).  Then I came across the Edit 120+ with the detachable case which fit the bill exactly.  Not haven actually seen the detachable bag yet, I was somewhat concerned about the method/design of the atachment.  It needed to be easy to remove, but it also needed to be secure; the pictures I found on the internet didn't show how it was attached.  

I was relieved when I actually saw how it was attached.  There is a slotted bottom on the main bag the entire length of the bag (an open slot is at each end).  The add-on bag has a wide semi-rigid flap that slides through the slotted bottom and a fold down tab on the free end that is secured by velcro.  The attachment method is secure and is almost invisable, and the design compliments the aesthetics of the original bag.  I think the original bag is very good, and the add-on detachable bag makes this a superb choice.  

Unfortunately, you have to buy this as a combination.  If you originally bought the 120 single bag version, it doesn't have the slotted bottom on it and can't be retrofitted (and I don't think they sell the detachable bag separately)

The case is protective and stylish without hindering the camera's ability to store and transport easily.  It's definately worth the dough to keep your Nikon S1 or S2 from scratching or even breaking from a minor fall

This case is vital to protect the lightweight S1 which could be easily damaged from a drop.  The case does not detract from the convenience of the S1, it adds virtualy no bulk to the camera so that it still slips in a pocket or a purse easily.

Yep, we love this camera! Amazon got it to us just in time for our trip to Las Vegas and we got wonderful footage and great still shots of our trip. The still shots are amazing, you can really zoom in close and get great clear shots of things our regular digital camera couldn't. In fact we tested this and have proof, as we had both cameras with us. My son got a great close up of Star Jones from far across the gathered crowd, right up to her face as if he were standing right in front of her, and my photo from the same area is so pixilated and blurry you can't even tell what the subject was! I love that we have two cameras in one, video and stills, so we don't have to carry both. I really like that there is a separate card for the still photos so low battery power doesn't threaten to wipe the memory clean. We eventually got a longer life battery but the one hour did just fine on our trip. It would be nice to have a separate battery charger, but it really didn't get inconvenient, we'd just plug it in while we slept and we were ready for the day when we woke up. And the price was excellent for all the features we got. Yep, we love this camera

I have been using the Fuji E550 for almnost two years, with none of the problems that have been reported by some of the reviewers. 

Here are the negatives: 

1) The flash has mediocre range and is a little finicky. If you don't depress the shooting button all the way, it may not flash. 

2) In bright light, the screen on the back is unusable - it washes out the image. BUT the camera has a fine viewfinder so this is not really a major issue.

The positives:

1) It takes great pictures. Really excellent.

2) It's small, and easy to carry.

3) The controls are well thought out and positioned on the camera body. Very easy to use. 

4) It has several automatic modes - sports, landscapes, portrait, etc, or you can use it on manual. I always use one of the programmed modes. 

5) The video option is not bad at all - my twelve year old (now 13) uses it.

I was so pleased with this camera I bought one for my administrative assistant about ten months ago, and she is very happy with it.

At it's current price I think this camera is a bargain. Only reason I didn't give it five stars is because of the weak flash.

I was amazed on how well this battery has performed. I did make sure when I got it I did a complete charge and complete discharge and it has not let me down since. I can shoot well over two hours without needing to change to the very meek battery that came with my camcorder (Sony HDR-HC1). It is thicker and sticks off the back a little bit more so you can not get your eye up to the eyepiece but I use the LCD when shooting anyway, and almost always on tripod

I have the Sony battery that came with the camera and bought an additional Sony battery that allowed for 2-4 hours. However, I wanted a battery that I could count on for the better part of an "all day" event and I found it in the QM91D.  

I was asked to photograph a wedding from getting ready (hair dresser at 0830, until the end of the reception at 11:30pm) The QM91D held strong.  I did not constantly video tape, but with my digital recorder I had 6 sony 120 tapes (60 min digital) -- 5 were captured using the QM91D.  I did switch some of the tapes before they were completely used to make sure I didn't miss important events ... so I never actually used up "all" of the QM91D battery.

This battery was used again during the evacuation from Houston (secondary to Hurricane Rita) -- I used it entirely and it did not faulter ... it lasted throughout the trip and I had no need to change to the smaller batteries.  

The size of the battery did not really bother me -- I was aware that it would be larger than the others and it did not hamper the use of the camera.

Read the manufacturer information on battery life, charging time etc ... for this battery it is valid.  

I would recommend this battery.

I purchased this kit, primarily for the extra battery, which retails for about what I paid for this item.  Having the backup battery is great, but I was pleasantly suprised by the soft case.  It protects my DSC-P200, without being bulky or heavy.  With the camera being so small, it was hard to find good protection without spending quite a bit of money.  The case for the memory sticks is nice as well.  It is easy to lose a stick if it's just floating around and the case keeps them securely.  All in all, this is an excellent value

The camera is good. Had it 1 week now. Low light it works and produces fair results. Bright light is much better. Small and light weight. You must use the supplied docking station to transfer as ther is no USB port on camera . There is the  DC in and TV out on camera (as well as the docking station...just no usb...why? ) 30GB hard drive is plenty...maybe too much. If you fill  this up you are looking at 8 DVD's and hours of transfer. The software is weak and conflicts with Roxio 7.5.  Roxio became unusable.  Roxio stinks anyway.  Found a simple program to burn after this...ASHAMPOO. Plan on getting Adobe Premier Elements, too. Amazon had the best deal...89 less 30 mail in rebate from Adobe.  Much better then the software in box.  My first cam as we now have a cute baby.  Easy to keep it rolling and have gigs to save.

Out of the box this is a simple to use camera.  The convenience of having the video or picture right on a hard drive is great.

I did a lot of searching and this one was the most bang for the buck.

Just starting to use it so can't say much for now.  My wife loved it for its size and weight

I have just purchased my second M407 Camera, yes that's right I said the second one. I purchased the first about a year ago and have used it in the Wilds of Idaho taking pictures in all kinds of weather at every elevation imaginable. All the pictures have turned out great. I recently had a reason to take more pictures indoors, new grand daughter. Again the pictures have been fantastic, have had several blown to 11X17 for matting and framing, great quality. I would make several suggestion to folks, buy digital camera batteries, every camera I have owned eats batteries, this HP is no different. If you spend the money and get good quality batteries they will last!  Second recommendation get a SD Memory card, if you are like me you will not be happy with the interanl memory and want to take lots of pictures.  So, this photographer says you can't beat the price, for the quality and service you get from HP. I forgot to mention I had a camera that didn't work, and HP replaced within 2 days with a new one, no questions asked. Good Service goes a long way in my book.  Buy one you won't be sorry!

After reading dozens of reviews for both this case and the PSC-55, I was still undecided on a case for my Canon SD630.  So, I purchased both to see for myself which one would work.  Because red is my favorite color, I really wanted the red case to fit (PSC-90).  The camera will fit in the case, but it's a VERY tight fit.  I had to shove the camera in the case to make the snap close.  The PSC-55 is still a very snug fit, but allows for some extra breathing room which I feel is better for the safety of the camera.

In addition, here's something to consider if you're deciding between the two cases: the inside lining of the PSC-90 is more of a rigid nylon material, while the lining of the PSC-55 is a softer felt material.  The case overall is still rigid, but I like the thought of my camera resting against a softer lining.  Based on that alone, I'm going with the PSC-55 - I feel that this will be more friendly to the 3" screen on the SD630.

Both cases are a very nice leather and are very attractive - I'm pleased with the Canon brand

when it comes to buying camcorders, i personally like the one with the build in memory. but after using this camcorder i was forced to change my mind. 
unlike other sony camcorders, first of all, it offers upto 40x zoom which is a lot. its a good use of your money. you can have it for under $400 and still works better than a lot of choices out there. easy to use, touch screen, takes still photos, has a good speaker so it's easier to record video and voice, fits into your palm so to speak, and if you use rewritable mini dvds, you wouldn't have to worry about go out of memory. 
 so when it comes to sony camcorders, i would say the better quality of this one would get the job done properly.

 This is my first digital camera. Prior to this I had a simple Kodak point-and-click model which pretty much the quality of a disposible.  I use much higher grade cameras at work both 35mm and digital.  This camera gives you the 5.1 MP ability though most shots only require the 3MP.  I like the 32MB internal memory though I've also bought a 256MB card for traveling. The 5x zoom isn't as cool as I initially thought it would be and digital zoom works sometimes and not others but you must understand what digital zoom really is.  The camera takes very clear and optimal pictures. Better pictures then I've taken on anything else I've owned before (and some of the work cameras as well).  The size is small enough to put in your pocket but not too small for one with larger hands. The different flash options and shooting scenes can turn difficult pictures into what you want to capture.   The panoramic shot sequence is an especially favorite feature especially for shoreline shots.  I've also bought the R-Series dock and enjoy its ability to transfer my pictures faster and charge two batteries at once.
  This camera is worth the price you pay but I believe its a 2005 model so it may not be the most up to date but it does a great job.

When I sow this in Amazon and read the spec. and everything on it I knew this is exactly what I'm looking for. It's portable, handy, and it's easy to use. The video has a great picture on it as well as the picture too. You can even download MP3 Music and use it to make music video, or any music of your own. Here's what you do,  Output the audio to a power Amp/ speaker so the performer will hear the music let the performer lipsink the music and start shooting the video. shoot different location at the same music and edit it whala you have just made the MTV Music Video

This camcorder is the best I have ever had!I have 5 others all higher and lower priced models for my business, I do video photography as one of my jobs. I love this camera, I dont know what would do without it! My kids can even operate it, we have made so many quality movies at home. I also use this camcorder for paid wedding and special occasion videos, it works great and I love the brand I really perfer it to others. Its not for you if you arent going to use alot or have a problem with the size, I dont think it's that big but then again I use some equipment thats enormous. This is not a palm Caamcorder. 
Once you figure out if this is the camera for you, you will be please, I enjoy it a lot!! There are descriptions of the camcorder, options and quality of the product on this page.
I love it and hope my short review helps. I know this is a non-detail review but all the info is on this page. This isnt for a person looking for a $400 dollar camera, if you want quality movies or use it for your job, ect. I really think this one is great! Hope this is useful, Camcorder Fanati

I had been searching web site after web site for a system like this.  I finally found a site where I could purchase seperate parts for a comparable system.  However, the receivers alone were more than this unit( If you wanted a receiver compatible with a plasma).  This works great.  Could not be easier to install.  All components are in my basement.  I ran the eye through the wall and have the eye barely exposed through a single cable face plate, with the blue led light taped to the back of the plate.  The blue light still shines through the faceplate, which is perfect. The faceplate is just below my wall mounted plasma set.  No interference.  This set up allows me to use this system at just about any angle in the room and the adjacent kitchen.  Works great with a basic $20 all in one ir remote. Also, the customer service is like no other.  I had several questions and each e-mail was answered by the next day with great help.  Made this purchase a no brainer. This is one product that far exceeded my expectations even after reading all the great reviews.  I highly recomend this product.

I have a wall hung plasma TV with speakers from my surround system mounted on either side. I was able to locate all the receivers in another room for a super clean installation. The Hot Pro IR target is very sensitive!! Initially I had the Hot Pro "box" too close to another TV and the blue indicator light was always on. If it's glowing, you need to move something. Once the indicator isn't lit but flashes when you use your remote, it works flawlessly

The only two drawbacks to this lens are that it requires a huge amount of light to take quality photographs and it is relatively slow to autofocus, especially where there is not adequate light.  Aside from this it is a good but not great lens.  It is probably worth the money that it cost, however, I believe that a better lens would be the 70 - 300 MM VR which costs about 4X the price of this lens

The GS150's performance is as-advertised. Terrific colour rendering, thanks to its 3-chip configuration. The camera also has the option of full manual control of standard settings, making it even more usable. Love the joystick! Still find it hard to believe that Panasonic has managed to fit all of this performance into such a small package.

Final Score: Engineering 1, Customer Service 0

Early production runs of this camera seem to have a shielding problem, which causes faint, red, horizontal bands to appear when recording in very low light conditions. Despite the fact this has been widely (if unofficially) reported by GS150 owners around the world, these same owners have noted that Panasonic customer service generally denies that the problem exists.

Thankfully, the problem is easily repaired by a certified technician. Better still, GS150 owners seem to have collectively deciphered that units manufactured from September 2005 onward are alright. Look for cameras with serial numbers beginning with 'H5' or higher. You can also read all about this at pana3ccduser dot com

I had to decide between this camera and a Panasonic.  we trust the Sony brand a little more, so we went with the Sony.  We were looking for an easy-to-use camera that we could just pick up and record our daughter...nothing professional but good enough quality to enjoy years later.  I also wanted a camera that could take still photos so we wouldn't need both a digital camera and a camcorder when we take vacations.  

Here's what I think so far:

Great camcorder to do exactly what we want -- picture looks great inside and out, VERY easy to use, and small enough to carry along almost anywhere.  

Still photos are not fantastic (only 3MP), but good enough for me.  Color and resolution are acceptable.    

Not easy to understand the LCD touch menus, but you can configure the buttons once you figure out which buttons you will use the most.

I got the bare minimums for accessories...bought a 1GB memory card (memory stick duo pro)...glad I did this since I will be taking stills and short video clips to email to the grandparents.  Also got a carrying case, DV tapes, and an extra NP-FP71 battery.  I'll be purchasing a firewire cable soon (I'm sure you've heard, the USB cable is inadequate for downloading video).  

Handycam station doesn't really bother me that much, but I can see what the fuss is about.  

All things considered, I'm extremely happy with my purchase.  I think this is a perfect camera for a first-time camcorder buyer who needs an EASY button (there's one on the side of the camera).  A little more expensive than some of the others, but the price is dropping.  

Best of luck!

I've owned the p-73 for about two years now.  One thing I'm noticing about a couple digital cameras in the amazon reviews, is that after a year or so, the camera has some kind of error or just dies completely.  For me, this hasn't happened with this camera.  It's always been great, and it has a lot of really convenient features.

When I bought this camera, I knew NOTHING about cameras.  I just wanted one really bad for some reason one day and went out and bought this one because it was PRETTY.  I got really lucky--I mean, I only bought it because it was pretty--I knew nothing about it.  But, nonetheless, I got lucky and bought this camera that takes AA batteries, came with a battery charger and its own USB cord.  It had a ton of settings on it.  Now that I understand more about photography, I really like the manual setting--the slowest shutter speed is 30 seconds compared to 10-15 seconds of even newer cameras in its class.

Like I said, i never had any problems with it.  Batteries always lasted long; took little time to recharge.  I never even bought a memory card for this camera--I use the lowest resolution to take pictures because that's all the given memory card can hold, and my pictures are still decent quality.

I'm now looking into a new camera because I do want excellent image quality, and, ironically, ever since I've been shopping for a new digital camera, my sony has been overexposing and underexposing about 20 percent of the shots i take; weird.

Anyway, if you're looking to buy a sony digital camera, based on my experience with this one, I'd recommend the brand

Through most of the 1990s, I lived overseas in both Europe and Asia.  Unfortunately, my number of photos from these times are limited to a handful as I hated looking like a "tourist" with my bulky camera!  Nowadays, I no longer have to worry about that because of cameras like this one!  I intially bought this T7 after using a friend's T1 and being impressed with the size of it.  The T7 is obviously considerably smaller, which is even better!  

I bought this camera right as they were coming out and paid well over $400 for it plus a 1GB Memory Stick Pro.  Both are investments that even to this day (over a year later) I am very happy with.  I have taken this camera just about everywhere and wherever I go people love to look at it.  I can say I've probably sold at least a dozen of these to people that fell in love with the size of the camera and the quality of photos it takes.  

As far as size, that is the biggest plus to it's advantage.  It can fit anywhere.  Even with the optional case that you can buy for it, it still easily fits in a trouser or jacket pocket, without even a noticable bulge.  

As far as photo quality goes, as most of the reviews note, the camera is very limited when it comes to night time shots.  I've found that these shots are often hit and miss as far as what you'll get, but for the size of the lens and the size of the flash, what can you expect?  After shooting a few thousand photos with this camera, I know what will be a good and bad night shot, and with the playback feature, you can quickly see the quality of your photo and retake if needed.  Is it perfect? No, but that's super tough in a camera this small.

Some reviews note the difficulty trying to take a photo while holding the camera still.  I've never had issue with this, but I could see how it could be an issue, it's just never one either my wife (the primary user) or I have dealt with.  I would venture that probably the vast majority of buyers of this camera will likewise not have a problem.

I've recorded more than a few .mpg movies with the camera and it surprisingly outperformed some of my bigger (and more expensive) point-and-shoot digital cameras.  I have been very pleased with that.  

Another drawback noted by many reviews is the LCD screen and the chance of breaking it.  I put a plastic screen protector (the thin plastic sheet type held by static) on it as soon as I bought it and haven't had a problem.  I've sat on the camera before (by accident, of course!) and have had it in luggage and the like, but have never had a problem.

The most significant drawback that I've had with the camera is that it can take more photos (esp with the 1GB card) than the battery will last.  Buy a second battery and you'll be more than good, but it's just something to keep in mind.

I would highly recommend this camera for anyone who travels, or anyone who wants a camera to take quick photos.  It can be carried anywhere and for the vast majority of shots, it's all that you need. I can say that we have many photos of our kids (and really good ones, too) that we would never had gotten if my wife didn't regularly carry this camera in her purse and diaper bag! I'm happy enough with it that I'm going to buy a second one for myself (especially now that the prices have dropped so much!) so that my wife can use our first one entirely for her own photography.  I give it five stars and would definately recommend it to others

Solidly built, this tripod balances well even when used with the heavier Sony Cybershots like the DSC-R1. The remote shuttle release button helps to further reduce camera shake, which is priceless when taking photos in conditions where camera shake is amplified (high optical zoom, supressed flash, etc).

What surprises me is the fact that the shuttle release button on the remote works exactly the same as any Sony Cybershot : press halfway to focus, and all the way down to capture the shot.

The zooming buttons do not work for the Sony DSC-R1 as the camera has a manual zooming ring, but they should work fine with any other Cybershot that comes with an electronic zoom and of course, an ACC terminal.

Highly recommended.

This is why sony is hot! This sexy little (yes its really small the size of a pack of cards) it takes perfect clear and crisp pictures and the battery life is a long 320mins perfect for a vacation, make sure to get a memory stick with it though, because w/o it it only holds about 15 pics. This is my first digital camera and I would definitely buy sony again

There some very detailed reviews, most of which I read before I ordered the camera from Amazon.  There is ample evidence that professionals will find the camera useful.  I want to take a minute to speak for the rest of us. The camera came a month ago and I've extremely happy with it.

Let me offer some perspective on my comments.  The last camera I bought was a small SONY shirt-pocket-sized camera that I was using alot and it got me back into taking pictures.  I decided that since I was taking so many pictures I wanted a camera that would take much better quality shots, WITHOUT my having to get a PhD in picture-taking.  I opted for this camera with the 18-200mm lens.  I now take the same pictures I took with the small camera, but with the zoom lens I can frame them better and with the 10.2 mega pixels I can blow them up and frame them. 

There are dozens (hundreds?) of features that I will grow into, but for now I am delighted to use this camera right out of the box, with just minimal reading of instructions.  Everything I remember from my 35mm days (my first camera was a Minolta SRT-101 that I bought in 1973) can be put to use, but what I forget, the camera remembers.

My point--this is a camera that is ready to meet you wherever you are and grow with you should you decide you want to go farther out and deeper in

5 stars...easy to use. The screen is large and clear. The automatic settings include a variety of scene selections (ie beach, party, fireworks scenes).  I have yet to use the video, so I cannot comment on that. I think this is a great all-around camera, and it fits in the smallest purses...big plus.  The screen has yet to get scratched in all my purse juggling.  

My only complaint would be in the shipping.  I paid extra to expedite my order since I was leaving the country a few days later. It was sent via UPS with a signature "in person" required.  When I missed UPS the first time, I was unable to just sign the paper and leave it on my door.  I had to contact UPS to find out when they would return so I could sign in person, which was an ordeal.  I wish I would've known that the camera was being sent this way.  I would've requested that no signature be required.

At first it was a little hard to get my pictures to look as good as the samples, but I found that by re-sizing them to about an inch or so on the computer before downloading them that they show up alot better. Also, the ones with higher contrast are easier to see farther away. Just look at the samples that come pre-loaded to remind yourself that it is possible to get great-looking pics at a surprisingly high resolution. After a few practice downloads I was thrilled with the results. **Another plus: this one came with a wall charger. Most have to be plugged in to the USB to charge. The wall charger makes it perfect to share on vacation when you're away from your computer

For less than $200 this is a great camera.  It is by no means spectacular, but for the price, it does a good job.  I own a Canon Powershot S60 as well, and the Canon outdoes this camera in some ways, but it's not pocketable.  The F20 is easy to use, the menu interface is fairly simple and self-descriptive, it powers up and is ready to take a picture quickly, and shutter lag seems average (close to the S60).  However, the only way to eliminate shutter lag is to buy a DSLR.  The "anti-shake" mechanism is not really useful at all, it merely boosts the ISO to 2000 which makes the image unprintable (at least indoors).  I have yet to try it this feature outside.  I've also found that dialing down the exposure compensation helps with the lowlights, especially outdoors.  Manually setting the ISO from 100-400 will, I hope, make for more printable, usable pictures.  I had actually thought of returning this little camera, but then realized that I could find nothing, for the price, that would be able to compete. I really wanted a 28mm lens, only found on more expensive models like the Canon sd800is, or Lumix's (which apparently have tons of noise at low ISO's).   It's pocketable, portable, and with a little tinkering you can get what you want from it.

You can use this one to find yardage to bunkers, creeks, etc. Very accurate and very useful. Well worth the money

It is light; has 6X magnification; and easy to use.  This little tool is great for any golfer.  You must know the yardage before you can select the correct club.  How far is it to either the top of that bunker next to the green or the flagstick?  Next,you just then need to pull the club that will get you there.  Fits on your belt through a loop in the safe carrying case or use the supplied clip to attached the case to your golf bag.  These NEW laser rangefinders are better than ever and at a lower price than previous models. LOVE IT

I got a Nikon laser rangefinder for Chrisymas and it had an 8x magnification. I found this to be to powerful for golf.I could not hold it steady on the flag.The 6x magnification on the Bushnell Yardage Pro Scout was much better. Also it is very compact and stores easily in my golf cart. The price from Amazon was well below I could find anywhere else.

I bought this camera as something a bit more capable, but not as expensive as an SLR. With a zoom equivalent to a 300 mm lens on an SLR, I certainly saved myself a heap of money over buying an SLR setup with the same capacities. 

I use this camera mostly in manual. That was my aim in buying it - to get more proficient in using the manual settings. A few times I have switched it to auto, and haven't been all that impressed. The autofocus seems a little unpredictable, but there is a single press manual focus button on the left side, as well as a focusing ring, and these do me very well indeed. I don't think I would recommend this camera to someone who wanted to use it mostly as a point and shoot. 

It loses one star mostly because of its poor macro capability. For really really good closeups it just doesn't come close to my Konica Minolta DImage Z6. 

I was a bit lost without image stabilization at first. This camera compensates for not having this by jacking up the film speed when in auto, and if I want to use it in manual and handhold, of course I have to do the same. Since I use a tripod a lot, this is not too much of an issue for me. I've heard a lot of bad press on the graininess at higher ISO, but I have found them to be at least as good as film if not better. 

The colors are great. I love my range of menu options, though there is nothing too extraordinary about them. This camera has more buttons than some, but once I got used to them, they make my selections so much faster when I am shooting in changing light conditions. 

I like the fact I can use a cable release with this camera. I have used it for quite a bit of low light work, and the fact that I can dial it right down to a twenty second shutter speed or even to B is fantastic.

I've found it pretty hard to find image editing software to work directly with raw images from this camera. 

It's working really well for me as a prosumer camera. However, I still think that if I could go back, I might go for a Panasonic DMC-FZ50 10.1MP instead. Maybe. I would have to check that one out more thorougly first

Well, I don't even know where to start for this camera. But about a year ago, when this camera first got launched to the digital camera market, it costed nearly twice as much as what you can pay for it now. For the price, this camera has alot to offer. I just love the color tone of Fujifilm. You get a very studio-like effect with Fujifilm CCD technology. This camera has many manual controls and features that will interest both professional and amature photographers. The 9 Megapixel can really be helpful when it comes to cropping. The pictures taken by this camera is bright and clear. The camera picture can be noisy if you set the ISO above 400. So, for the best result, just set the ISO level as low as possible (lets say ISO 80?). The 10.7X zoom lens is very convenient when you want to get close to the subject you are shooting. I used this camera for every occasion and it never failed me. I heard alot of complaints about the poor battery life of this camera, but just buy NiMH battery that is about 2500 mAh and above and you should get about 200-250 shots. Make sure to buy at least a 2 GB memory card because the picture files are pretty big, especially in RAW format. Also, for the price, this camera feels VERY SOLID in the hand. It feels very professional and sturdy (MADE IN JAPAN). The buttons are nicely placed and very easy to use. Make sure to buy an external flash if you want to do some serious light photography. I recommnend the Sunpak 383 non-dedicatted flash to go with this camera. It works together really well. Anyway, for $407, you cannot get a better camera than this one. Thank you Amazon for making this good deal possible. Again, I highly recommend this camera.

Solid construction, good optics, nice sound.  As mentioned by others, the output for the USB transfer is found in the handycam console and not the camera itself...a minor annoyance.  All in all, this is a good camera that is touch pricy but you do get what you pay for....

This is a very good camcorder with the main problem I noted being the DVD format giving only 30 minutes or so of recording in HD mode per disk. It is also a problem that only Blue-Ray DVD players can play back the DVD in HD mode. Even worse that it might destroy the disk if you use it on another player. Nevertheless, the price was good and I think Blue-Ray will be more affordable in the near future. Meanwhile, I can playback my video directly or send it to the computer. I am glad I bought it. If a MiniDV tape version were available at the same price now I think it might be better to stick with the tape version for now though. I was sent a bad power supply with the camcorder but Sony sent a new one right away. Be careful to buy the correct battery and external charger accessories for the camera as it is a bit confusing as to which will work for it. Overall - I am very happy with the camcorder

This camera delivers excellent video quality.

I use it with the hot-shoe attachable microphone and the audio is quite good.

I've plugged this into my HD television and the quality is excellent.  I have also had the Optura Xi from Canon and while the build quality of the HV20 is not quite as good as that of the Optura Xi, the video quality is nothing short of stunning.

This is a very good deal for $1000.  You won't be disappointed

I mainly use the camcorder for recording my kids.

I bought this camcorder a couple of weeks ago.  I had the sony hc-7 before for a couple of weeks which I returned to buy the canon camcorder.  

The high light performance of both camcorders are excellent.  With the sony camcorder, I felt that the best color performance can be achieved by reducing the color intensity.  The low light performance when recording 1080i is similar for the two camcorders but much better with canon when recording in 24p format.  This is the main reason that I prefer the canon.  The 24p recording is more sensitive to motion which can be a problem if recording motion.

The still images from canon are lower resolution but to me they looked better than sony.  This is especially true when taking flash pictures.  
The sony seems a little better built.  The hdmi cover on canon is poorly built.

I liked the controls on canon better than sony.
The auto focus and automatic white balance worked better in canon than in sony.  The auto white balance in sony worked poorly in indoor light.

Sony has supershot infrared recording and canon does not.

Sony has more manual controls than canon.

You can't beat the HD picture quality from the HV20 based on actual user reviews and comparisons with all of the latest models. While this is a single CMOS sensor, it is a true 1920 x 1080 HD sensor of the same quality found in the award winning Canon Digital SLR cameras. Don't be fooled by a 3CCD camcorder that uses smaller sensor sizes and must use "pixel shifting".

I had already hooked up the HV20 to my 720p projector, and it did look great even at my typical 120". But I do know that my projector probably isn't calibrated very well to be honest.

So, my first WOW moment came when I decided to capture some of my best outdoor footage from my Canon Elura stock and compare it to some HV20 footage shot of my kids over the weekend at an Easter egg hunt. WOW, the difference in quality was even more pronounced than I realized. I guess that the resolution difference is what it is, but this is definitely serious HD quality.

The real defining WOW moment that has me "selling" all of my family and friends on this camcorder came last night when I hooked it up at my brother-in-law's house to his Sony Wega CRT HDTV display that does 1080i and is calibrated to perfection. You won't find a higher quality HD display than his set IMO, and my jaw dropped when my video first came up on his display  That was the first time when I was truly able to see what my source footage was capable of in terms of its full resolution and AMAZING colors. We switched to Discovery HD on his set, and other than obvious production value aspects you honestly couldn't really say that it looked any more HD than the footage of my kids playing.

This is way more exciting to me than when I first saw broadcast HD and watched Monday Night Football because it is hard to describe how cool it is to see your kids on video in beautiful HD for a $1,000 price point. I can hardly wait to get out there and shoot some more footage.

This review is for the Coolpix 5900 with 5MP. 
You will not be displeased with this camera if you are in the 
market for a compact digital camera. This little baby lies 
comfortably in your pocket until you want it and rarely fails 
to deliver, no matter what lighting obstacles you throw in it's 
path. The footprint is amazingly small for a 5MP and you'll be 
amazed at the functionality. I found the video/movie feature to 
be a real useful tool that surprises most people with the great 
clarity and utterly blown-away at night shots in poor light. 
Think of Las Vegas lights on the strip, or a crowd of people 
in thin night light. This camera handled it all. The SD card 
is easy to access, and I recommend a 1GB size so you can take 
your time with movies. Otherwise a 512MB card will give you 
about 300 photos. But I warn you, you will be bitten by the 
movie bug and want to use this more and more (provided you have 
disk space or burn the excess to DVDs). I also recommend the 
San Disk Ultra II SD cards for fast recovery speeds, so you 
don't have to wait for each shot to record before going to the 
next shot (this is 5 MP and that's a lot of pixals to store). 
The roll on the side of the body enables you to keep a tight 
grip on it with one hand shots- a feature many small cameras 
lacked. The battery life is exceptional, but as always, buy a 
backup for travel. The hit of one star was for the frustratingly small on/off button. I know they designed it so that it won't accidentally turn on in your pocket, but my fat finger is not the best tool.... The 2 inch LCD is not protected like others too, but so far seems pretty tough, rolling around in my pocket with sunglasses and other things that so far have not scratched it.

I have a Canon EOS Rebel which takes fantastic pictures.  I use it around home and when I am setting up static shots such as family portraits.  The only problem is...who wants to lug it around to take snapshots.

Despite some of the above opinions about lack of sharpness, I have had no such problems.  The 5900 is great for "grab" shots and it's not too shabby for setting up a planned shot using it's advanced controls. 

Be sure that you buy a FAST memory card.  This will reduce the time between shots.  As in most cameras, a memory card is not supplied with the camera.  Mr. Goyal's review about not being able to take pictures without a memory card is not true.  You can take a LIMITED number of shots with the internal memeory. 

The only real problem I have is the red-eye reduction feature.  I usually turn it off as the delay between the "red-eye" flash and the main flash is too long.  The subjects often think the shot is over and start to move.  Anyway it is easy enough to remove it later, either with photo-software or with the photo kisok in the drug store

Got this camera in 1999 and it is still doing very well!  More than 3000 great pictures have been taken.  The camera is very easy to use and needs no maintenance.  A word of caution - ensure that the camera doesn't get pressurized laterally - this can happen if it is stuffed in a bag and someone sleeps over it.  The spring-operated shutter is very sensitive.

Would recommend this for anyone who is looking for a cost-effective and easy-to-use film camera

This is a nice bag, but don't buy it for a Canon S2 IS it will not fit.  The product compatibility lists the S1 IS since the S2 and S1 are very similar I purchased this bag.  I can't even get the thing in the bag.  It is a nice bag however and have put my smaller Kodak camera in it.  There is plenty of room for a typical point and shoot camera and all of it's accessories.  Good quality

Its a cable, it works, what else do you want?  I know its not the cheapest one out there, but this one says "sony" on it.  Yea!!  But, I am a true believer that you only get what you pay for.  Im sure its better quality than the five dollar version at the flea market.  who knows, but I sure feel all warm and fuzzy about getting quality sony products.

This is my second digital camera. Although it does so much more than my first, it is much easier to operate. I especially love the fact that I can video my grandson's baseball game, and then convert individule frames to photos (jpeg) with great quality. I have a series of photos with him getting a hit. It looks great!

Thanks for a great product.

This product delivers exactly as promised and we could not be more pleased.  The pictures are wonderful.  The initial downloading process was straighforward and problem-free. We actually purchased three photo frames for ourselves and our children and they love them as much as we do.  The slideshow feature is wonderful as well. Everyone of our friends that have seen the photo frame are equally amazed by this product as some were not aware that such a product even existed. To be sure, they are expensive but worth the cost.  We will enjoy our photo frame for years to come as we update with new pictures regularly.  Thanks to the folks at Philips for getting this soooooooooooo right.

We just got this camera after much research.  The camera is easy to use and we like it but frustrated that it doesn't do some of what was advertised.  For the most part tho for the price and all it is fine.  Just read all the directions and don't be to disappointed if it doesn't play your old 8 mm tapes and a few other things like that.
I wrote to Sony and they said that this model doesn't do a few things.  SO MAIN POINT HERE IS READ AND READ AND KNOW WHAT IT IS.

I liked the service we received thru Amazon.  No problems ther

Do not expect this to replace the zoom from your camera. It will not do that nor was it intended to do so. What it does do is optically bring things a little bit closer. This is certainly preferably to using the digital zoom that comes with so many cameras. 

The lens works by screwing into the end of the camera lens where filters would normally be put. This means that it is something which must be planned for to be used. It is not to be put on while filming is taking place; it is in place when filming begins. Since it is easy to use, this should not take too long. The normal zoom of the camera can be used while this lens is in place. Having it in place just changes the limits from a little bit closer to what would normally be the case to not quite as far when the camera is zoomed out to maximum. Care should be taken not to get this lens cross threaded when putting it in place.

The quality of the optics seem to be fine. I used it on a Sony DCR-VX2100 and had no problems.

This is a handy gadget to have handy in your case but be aware of what it will and will not do.

I purchased this battery as a back-up to the one that came with the camcorder. The great thing about this is, once charged, it can sit in a camcorder for a month without loosing any power. I discovered this last week when I wanted to use the camcorder and was worried that the battery may be dead by now but ...surprise surprise. Its recharge time is very fast.

The only negative part (if I must have to give) is, it's a little bigger then the one that comes with camcorder.

I say go for it.

This case is the perfect size to hold our Sony Camcorder and a few blank tapes.  We purchased it for a cruise, because we wanted to carry-on the camcorder and have it protected, but not have to lug the large case we owned that holds all the accessories.  This smaller case still protects the camera and allows room for some extras

This is a very flexible and capable camera. If you are looking for more than a point &amp; shoot will offer, there are very few that would compare. For me the deciding factor was the high quality lieca lens with wide angle, if you havent compared this directly with a conventianal lens you will be amazed at what youve been missing. the 16:9 is an ok feature if you plan on HDTV veiwing but the screen size is compromised when you switch to 4:3. i would prefer a larger screen and lose the 16:9 feature. the lens cap is a little annoying as well but those issues aside, i am very satisfied

At least for now it is :-) .  During the course of the past 10-12 months I have owned 7, that's SEVEN, digital cameras: Canon S230; Kodak V530; 5 different models of Casio's: Z60, Z600, Z850, P700; and most recently presented my wife with a red S770 for Valentine's Day.  I also had a pretty good chance to evaluate Canon SD450 (my brother-in-law owns one - it was actually a gift from my wife and I to him for his 21st birthday), Casio EX-S600 (a good friend of mine owns one), and Panasonic DMC-TZ1 (once again, a gift from my wife and I to my father-in-law for his last birthday).  If you read any of my digital camera reviews (and I've written a few by now), then you know that I'm not particularly fond of Canon's lately - I think they are overrated and overpriced for what they have to offer.  As I also mentioned before, I've tried several different Kodak models (and I used to work for the company too!), but all of them turned out to be a waste of my time, to say the least.  I became a big fan of Casio's, although not all of my experiences with them were great.  But being a huge gadget "freak" that I am, and constantly wanting new "toys", I have always craved for more.  Over time, my tastes in digital cameras have changed from having a simple point and shoot type of camera to wishing for more power and manual control.  So one by one, I returned/sold all of my cameras, and after extensive (and I really do mean extensive) research, I got myself an LX2.  I must say though that I probably wouldn't have without getting to know my father-in-law's TZ1 first.  I was actually quite impressed with it.  Powerful zoom, sharp lens, decent picture quality.  I also played with some other Panasonic models in various stores just to get a better feel for them, as well as spent a few hours on the phone, and exchanged numerous e-mails with a friend of mine who owns an FZ30, and who swears by it.  Unfortunately, LX2 was not available anywhere locally, but I felt that I got a pretty good understanding of what Panasonic's cameras are all about, and after some more thought and consideration, I went ahead and bought it from Amazon (nice thing about buying from Amazon is that you can always return whatever it is you bought, including digital cameras, within 30 days for a full refund, no questions asked).  I did know about the "Noise" issue at high ISO's, but it wasn't a decisive factor for me, and I'm glad I didn't pay much attention to it and got the camera anyway.  It turned out to be one of the best purchases I've made in a long while.  Here is why:

PROS:
- Superb design.  This camera is wonderfully crafted.  And I absolutely love Black!  It gives the camera a nice, clean, professional look.  I don't think I'll be buying another silver camera soon after having this one;

- Intuitive controls, and menus.  I charged the battery, put it into the camera, and started using it and taking pictures right away, without even going through the manual once;

- A load of features, including a large, bright, widescreen LCD; wide angle, super sharp Leica lens with a 4x zoom; Mega OIS - optical image stabilization control (optical means it's done mechanically, which is a TRUE way of doing stabilizing, comparing to other cameras where it's done by "tricking" the camera into using higher ISO's); and many more.  In addition, it has a joystick for an easy access to different menus, has a number of manual controls, as well as provides ability to shoot in RAW format (more on that later);

- It comes with SilkyPix Developer Studio software for working with camera RAW files.  For someone who is not familiar with RAW - it's a "pure", camera specific picture format.  It varies upon a manufacturer, meaning that Canon RAW is different from Nikon or Panasonic RAW, for example.  And it's "pure" in a sense that it's of a much better quality than a standard JPEG (JPG), and doesn't suffer from loss of information, such as white balance, or brightness.  There is a lot more to RAW than that, and I'm not going to go into details right now.  What I want to say, however, is that having previously owned a camera which supported RAW format (Casio EX-P700), I must have tried about a dozen of different RAW editing software packages, including products from Adobe, Ulead, ArcSoft, PhotoFiltre, Picture Window Pro, ACDSee, LightZone, Image Broadway, and more. SilkyPix delivered by far the best results of all.  The only one that I would probably put next to it is Bibble;

- Noise - What Noise?!  I really hate it when I hear people complaining about noise in this camera (after having it tried myself), or any other compact digital camera for that matter.  Are you really that na?e that you think that you will get absolutely no noise in your images using a compact digital camera?  Think again.  You might have noticed that I've used the word "Compact" several times here.  I've done it on purpose - it is inevitable for a compact digital camera to produce some noise.  Some cameras are better than others, but no matter how hard you try, you will see some.  This camera is no better or worse than any other one that I've had/tried.  At higher ISO's (above 400), it's slightly more visible, but who in the right state of mind is using anything over ISO 200 on a compact digital camera, such as this one, anyway?  I always have mine set to a 100.  If I feel that it doesn't get the job done, I shoot in RAW;

- Picture Quality is Very Good.  Yes, it does take some time getting used to, but once you familiarize yourself with everything this camera is capable of, you can achieve spectacular results, especially if you don't mind doing some post processing.

As much as I like everything this camera has to offer, there are, however, some things that kind of irritate me.  Here is a short list of bad things about this camera, otherwise known as

CONS:
- First of all, this camera has actually been somewhat misrepresented.  It's been advertised as a 10.2 megapixel camera, which is not entirely true.  10.2 MP resolution is available ONLY in 16:9 (wide) aspect ratio.  Two more ratios are available - 3:2, and a more conventional 4:3, but those offer 8.5, and 7.5 MP resolutions respectively.  So if you compare this camera to others that don't have a widescreen format, or if you prefer to shoot only in a regular 4:3 mode, then this camera should only be referred to as a 7 MP digital camera (because not all the pixels are actually effective).  Obviously, Panasonic is aware of it, and marketed it having higher pixel count on purpose, to boost consumer's interest;

- I expected to see a compact digital camera.  What I got instead was actually a smaller compact camera than I expected.  I was really surprised to see how small, yet convenient to hold and operate, the camera body was.  What I didn't like, however, was the lens.  Not the lens itself, it's actually quite superb, but the fact that it sticks out.  I like cameras with lenses that retract all the way back to the camera body.  I realize that it would probably loose some features, like the wide angle, and perhaps zoom, but I still wish it did that.  It would be so much more... umm... compact?!  The way it actually is makes it quite difficult to find the right case for it.  Almost impossible, I should say.  I've tried a few, but they are either too small or too big.  I just can't find one that would fit right.  I put an order for an SLX1B case for it, which is specifically designed to fit LX1, and LX2 models, but I hear they are not that good.  We shall see;

- I'm not a big fan of a pop-up Flash.  I always keep forgetting to open it when I need to use it.  And it also seems a bit flimsy.  I'm treating it as carefully as I can, but I just can't stop thinking that it might break soon;

- I hate the Lens Cap!!!  There, I said it.  It's probably just one of those small annoyances that keep frustrating you until you get used to it, but for now I'm not really happy with it.

SUMMARY:
Despite very few minor negatives, I think LX2 is probably one of the best, most innovative cameras on the market today, and I sure am glad to have one.  It offers more than any other camera in the same price range, and can even compete with some DSLR's when it comes to picture quality.  If you are someone like me, who wants to have more control and/or learn more about digital photography, or a DSLR user who just needs a solid backup to carry everywhere, then this camera is not be overlooked!  Highly recommended

This is a great camera. The quality is good and the camera is very durable. I've accidently dropped the camera several times, and it still works. However, I would suggest getting a memory card if you want to take more than 24 pictures at a time.

I owned a Kodak for awhile and was pleased with the pictures however, my husband accidently fell while ice skating and broke my camera.  My family, knowing I love to take pictures, decided to replace my camera, but this time with a Sony Cybershot.  I have never been more unhappy with a camera.  Needless to say, I finally decided to purchase this Kodak Z650 and am so pleased with the results and pictures.

I am not a professional photographer, just someone who likes to take photos of my kids, pets, flowers, vacation spots, etc.  My Sony was HORRIBLE at action shots and if you had ANY movement what so ever, the photo appeared blurry.  Having kids, that isn't an option.  I gave that camera to my daughter to do whatever she wanted with it.  The Kodak, however does a wonderful job of action shots as well as clear, crisp and concise pictures.  I absolutely love this camera!  

I will never go back to another brand and have only good things to say about Kodak and their products

I bought this camera to replace my 35 almost a couple years back.  I am an avid nature photographer so most of my work is taken in the outdoors.  After hundreds of pictures and all kinds of weather here's the lowdown...

Pros ... Picture quality is amazing even after zooming the full 10X (I never go into digital zoom because of low quality of pictures, although this camera isn't too bad after complete full optical and digital zoom).  Prints that I've made up to 16X20" (haven't gone larger, but I know I can) are extremely impressive and are as crisp as viewing a 4x6.  It is easy to use and the functions are easy to get to with the use of the joystick.  The stabilization at full 10X zoom is incredible also.  It appears really shaky through the window, but pictures continue to turn out crisp.  Close-ups are clear and reveal amazingly clear details.  The movie feature works better indoors than the regular camera portion (read cons).

Cons ... Indoor shooting is limited because the flash isn't strong enough.  When at a school chorus concert, the pictures turned out fuzzy and unclear.  Award ceremonies, the pictures turned out once again unusable in my standards.  The zoom is fixed when using the movie feature so you need to have the zoom set before beginning a movie.  This camera seems to eat batteries, especially in the winter months.  I am always on the go, and when I go to pull out the camera I find the camera lens cover has fallen off yet again.  It comes off way to easily causing smudges and smears on the lens so I must always have lens cleaner wipes on me.  The viewing window cover has also come off and is lost in the woods somewhere, but that also is minor.

Most of the cons really are all minor things that don't interfere with the amazing quality of the pictures as long as you are properly prepared for those minor issues.  I tried to be as precise about this camera as possible.  All in all, I would highly recommend this camera to the avid photographer.  If you plan on using a camera on mostly indoor activities, just keep in mind for the flash to work good, keep your subjects close.  It's been bumped, jostled, and droped a couple of times and the camera still works like a gem

I bought this camera for myself at Christmas. It is my first digital camera purchase. I love the clarity of the pics. I love the shutter speed!
I do wish the lens cap would stay on better, but that is so minor compared to my likes of the camera.

If you use the viewfinder instead of the LCD field, it does not appear on the LCD, you can only see it through the viewfinder.  This is different from previous models.  Minor annoyance.

The quality of the videos was surprisingly good, but it saves them in the QuickTime .Mov format.  Mov is not my favorite format, but perhaps others will not be bothered by this.  

Although I had heard that the color on Kodaks is not natural, I have found it to be excellent.  The overall quality of the pictures is good.  

For the price, I think this is a very good value and adequate for most casual photographers.

I stumbled across this little gem by accident.  I was picking up supplies at Office Depot and they had a Kodak Z650 (display model) on sale for under $100. It was a ridiculous impulse buy--I already own 4 digital cameras ... the last thing I needed was another camera! But what a delighful suprise this camera turned out to be! It's come the closest to rivaling the image quality of my old Olympus C-740. 

I had never seriously looked at Kodak cameras ... I always steered clear of them based on bad press and negative comments about them from my friends who are "serious" photographers. 

But I couldn't be happier with this little bargain ... it basically serves the need I wanted to fill -- a 6mp camera that takes the kind of quality shots I was used to with my C-740.

There are a few negatives in that it can be a little slow in processing the shots, but there is very little shutter-lag when taking the shots. I've gotten some amazing birds-in-flight shots with it--something I've never been able to accomplish with any of my other cameras, including the C-740. Some low-contrast shots come out a bit noisy, but for the most part the shots are very crisp and sharp. It handles low-light settings better than any of the others in this class that I've tried. 

At less than a third of the price of my Canon S2-IS, this little camera outclasses the others by a mile.

I stumbled on to a good find in the Z650 ... it's not going to give you DLSR quality photos, but no point-and-shoot will.  

This camera is perfect for any one who likes to take great outdoor and wildlife shots.  I just wish someone would have given a good report on Kodak cameras before I spent a small fortune on the others

The Bushnell Powerview 12x25 is a fine, small pocket-sized binocular.  Since my wife is an avid bird watcher, we already have several binoculars of various sizes and viewing power.  Our grandson accidentally broke her small 10x25 Bushnell that we used for trips, so I researched, then bought this one from Amazon for her birthday.  She loves it.  The viewing power is a bit greater than the other and is every bit as compact, which makes it easy to pack for vacations, yet provides for a good viewing experience when enjoying the various bird populations around the country.  We both highly recommend this, and other Bushnell products

I was using this lense for a week now with D50 and I can tell you that in low light indoor shooting this lense is AWESOME. At 1.8f this lense should be fast enough for any semi-profesional (like myself). At 8f this lense produces the most sharpest photo ever and given that you shoot in NEF (RAW) format and use photo editor software (I use Nikon's Capture NX) photoes become master pieces. At 22f, outside group portrait are sharp to the last hairy detail on each single person. I highly recommend this lense

I was looking to expand my lens collection without breaking my budget and found this 50mm to be an excellent first choice. I love being able to shoot in low light situations which this lens has allowed for me to do. However, the auto-focus leave a lot to be desired as far as speed and accuracy goes. I've found leaving it in manual focus allows me to get more shots faster, at least in low light.

I would recommend this to anyone looking for a way to take video and pictures without the hassle of lugging around (and charging) two separate gadgets.  It takes excellent pictures, just as good if not better than any other digital camera I have seen.  I am also very pleased with the video - I found the software very user friendly and video was easy to transfer and edit on my computer.  The battery has a good life, I have had no problems having to stop and recharge it.  There is a nite mode that compensates (very well, I think) for low light video.  The camera is easy to carry around (it is smaller than my 35mm) and I am having no problems with the functionality - all in all a great idea and easy to use with great pictures and great video

I have no complaints. I have had this camera for over a year and a half and it has been reliable, fast, and gives me crisp, quality photos! The only option I wish this camera had was a better stabilization mode to prevent blurred pictures, but the software edits the blur without reducing the quality. Blurry pictures are not a problem as long as you know how to aim and shoot. Everyone loves playing with my camera because it has many cool features to make your photos fun! I highly recommend this camera (especially to beginners or for those who just want a simple camera that can capture those precious moments, with high quality photos). Excellent camera overall! ;

The beauty of this charger is that it is 110/220v compatable, so with the appropriate international connector you can charge your batteries on European voltage.  I have used two of these with the plug adapters and have kept four sets of batteries charged overnight for two olympus cameras giving a day plus of batteries available for each.  Very few cheap US chargers offer this multi voltage compatability.  Lots cheaper than multiple voltage convertors.  If you plan on traveling internationally, this charger is a must!

I have been using Kodak cameras for years. This is my third Kodak digital camera. It does everything, including taking excellent close-up wildlifephotos. It is as easy to use as a point and shoot. However, it does have all the bells and whistles needed for a professional style camera. It is well worth the money. Look no further this is the camera for you

I got this camera so I could have more control.  I'm learning to use the shutter and aperture settings...I haven't explored all the fancy settings much, but there are tons of them.  I really like the continuous shooting option so I'm more likely to catch a good action shot.  The wide-angle lens has also allowed me to get some pretty cool shots and the macro settings work great for close-ups.  I think it's one of the best buys you can find if you want to take some pretty cool photos, but don't feel quite ready for an SLR

This is a must have item for your kodak dig. camera.
It allows for filters, tele/wide aux lenses or any 55mm screw on attachment.
Apart from that the black metal enclosure compleatly covers the entire lens assemby, at any zoom or focal length.
This adds a very strong and valuable protection to your lens.
If you accidentally bang the camera against a hard surface this adapter may very likely save your lens (camera) from destruction.  I always keep it on with a skylight filter, the skylight or a UV filter further protects the lens from impact, scratches and dust.  If used when the lens is not fully extended ex: wide angle to normal zoom, the adpter also helps block out stray light and acts as a light shade. Kodak aught to have this built into their camera as a permanent fixture, but alas they make extra revenue on their accessories.
Do Buy It!

Seems Panasonic has finally dropped the hammer on the pseudo DSLR market, with 420mm at 12x or 749mm - 21.4x at 3mp is outstanding especially with OIS. excellent pictures out of the box, menu operations are plentiful, NR can be reduced and the jog dials front and back for Aperture or shutter is very professional.

Leica lens is crisp and sharp, I shoot in Aperture priority with NR at minimal and the pictures even in Jpeg look like they have been post processed, simply amazing.

After experiencing this camera I sold my Nikon D80, attachment lens and soft pictures Nikon was giving me is unacceptable, i went thru every menu option including using the much hyped RGB3 which by the way gives cartoon colors has no comparison to the Panasonic.

High speed USB is my only complaint for data transfers, Noise reduction for higher ISO noise is a bit over powering but acceptable but controllable at your liking, a 3" ,screen would be nice but maybe on the next model.

BTW, moon shots with the Raynox 2020 at 3mp give a zoom of 47.08x optical or 1647 mm optical, hand held shots with OIS (image stabilization) enabled gives jaw dropping pictures, you actually have a telescope with OIS at your reach, simply amazing.

100% satisfied.

This is my third digital camera and by far my favorite. I purchased after having a very versatile but large (well large in the dimensions of digital cameras) digital camera. I needed and wanted a camera that I could easily carry w/ me at all times. This is perfect.

The Fugi Z1 fits easily into your pocket or a small case for easy access. Just don't put anything else in that pocket! The one time I forget and did this I noticed a large scratch on the silver portion of the camera.

As with all digital cameras this one takes much better pictures in good lighting. I have found, however, that this tiny camera has an excellent flash so I am still able to get good interior shots if I am willing to blind people (or my cats) for a few seconds.

The camera comes w/ a docking station that I have found very useless for uploading pictures but you have to use it to charge the camera. I tend to just use a USB cable direct to the computer or a really cheap USB card reader that I can attach directly to my computers USB port.

I took this camera to Japan and it was great. I only had one day where I ran out of battery power but that was my own fault.

This is a highly recommended camera by me

This is NOT a high-tech digital frame. It doesn't play MP3's.  It doesn't come with a remote.  It simply reads your digital pictures from a card and displays them in a slide show mode.  There's an "on" button and an "off" button.  There is no manual to read in order to learn how to operate your frame (though it does come with a one-page instruction sheet).  It's great for your office desk when all you need to do is reach over and turn it on or off.  If you want to display it in a difficult-to-reach location, or choreograph your pictures with music, then this is not the frame for you

I decided I wanted this a while before i got it. As I read reveiws I realized majority of them were postive. There is nothing wrong with it, the microphone works really good but you can not watch your videos with sound on the camera. It can take around 300 some pictures and about 60 minutes of video on Super sine mode, where it uses the most megapixels. It is definetly something I would recommend for anyone

I purchased the Axion 10.4" frame for my wife to replace a defective Polaroid frame from a different source.  The Axion stacked up quite nicely to the other "more expensive" frame.  The Axion is viewable from more angles than the Polaroid frame with a cheaper price tag.  Quality of the display is BETTER on the Axion and we have not had any technical issues.

PROS:
Brightness control
Color and Contrast of display
Ease of setup and operation
Good sound from speakers on music playback

CONS:
Slide show transitions are from top to bottom only.  Different transitions would be a nice feature.
Remote does not control volume of music.

Overall the advantages of this frame outweigh the disadvantages.  We have been very happy overall with this purchase

Well, I'm just amazed this model is still in production the way things are changing so quickly in the A/V world.

I bought mine two years ago and have recorded many hours of my children as they are growing up.  This is a truly low maintenance and low cost solution for your video recording needs if you don't have a lot of money to spend on a digital set-up.   

Just buy and extra after market battery or two (and they're cheap) and some inexpensive analogue tape, and start recording away!

After you climb the learning curve, of course.  My one problem with this camcorder is that the controls are anything but intuitive, and they're splattered all over the unit.  Be sure to read the user manual carefully before you try to use this thing, but once you've got it down you'll find this a trusty and low cost companion for your family vacations and holidays.  

Oh yeah, almost forgot, the microphones aren't stereo but they're really quite good for an entry level unit

One of the reviews I read before purchasing these suggested that the reviewer should've had them for her Celine Dion concert.  I took the suggestion and they were perfect!  They fit nicely in my evening bag and brought Celine closer to me as I sat in the Second Mezzanine at Caesar's Palace!  Not only that - but the price was right! I couldn't be happier!  Plus, now I have them for our next trip to Rocky Mountain Park to get up close and personal to some wildlife

I really wanted a 3CCD model, but since I'm just starting out and need to buy other stuff, like a tripod, monopod, media, firewire adapter card, camera bag, etc. This fits the budget nicely and it is compact enough to carry it anywhere. Yes the USB connection does work, yes FireWire does work, although it took me a minute to figure out that a connection problem was the fault of the video software version I was using, not the fault of the camera

This is a well made head constructed of solid metal with a nice finish.  There are no plastic parts and even the rubber piece on the quick release plate is hard rubber.  I have used it every week for about two years and have had no problems with it.  I use it mainly attached to a monopod for sports photography and videography.  The quick release has a clever locking mechanism to prevent accidental release.  I bought an extra quick release plate so I can switch between two cameras.

Tilt only -- no swivel:  Amazon (and others including Bogen) calls it a Swivel Tilt Head, but that seems to imply that it moves in two directions -- tilting (up and down) and swivelling (side to side or panning).   This head only moves in the tilting direction which allows you to orient the camera in either landscape or portrait modes.

The tilting action could be improved if the head clicked into the upright position when you tilt it back to landscape.  When you are going to the portrait mode, there's no problem since it stops at 90 degrees.  However, when I want to go back to landscape, I have to hold it out and look at it to see if it's level.  A subtle click to know I'm there would be nice

This item is cute. My only complaint is that it really can only hold the camera. There is no space for an extra card or battery. It does however have a convenient belt clip on the back that you could also attach a shoulder strap to.

I have had great luck with other Opteka lenses, but I had to by a thread adapter. What is the thread size of this lens here? I need to know before I buy. Opteka, please put thread sizes of your lenses in the description. Thanks!

I am really enthusiastic about this lens because it is an excellent accessory for my camera at a very convenient price.  I add it and use it for landscapes, mountain views, nature images and such, and also for group pictures in family photos.   It does what is supposed to do: it increases the field of view while keeping the whole image very clear, and in this way the pictures appear more natural -- a whole view and not a narrow frame -- with perspective and deepness also, quite similar it seems to me to what I see with my own eyes.   A very useful additional tool

I purchased this camera brand new for a fraction of the price of my first digital camera.  This is my second point and shoot digital camera since I have abandoned film.

It is a very solid and durable and it takes beautiful pictures.  It has almost no shutter lag time and the battery has never run out on me.  I have used it on an entire week long vacation without re-charging it.

Kodak keeps making these cameras better and more reliable for less

I have to get on the bandwagon here.  This is a superb little camera, definately five stars!  I also have the TZ1, which showed promise, but has  limitations. In my review of the TZ1, I noted it had lots of "noise" and pictures shouldn't be printed much beyond 4x6 inches if they were to be sharp.  I also wanted more manual controls.

The TZ3 fixes and improves almost everything about the TZ1 and adds some new, very useful features.  The noise has been drastically reduced, the lens is better, the sensor is bigger, and the processor is not only faster, but produces better pictures.  The TZ3 adds a very handy "function" button - or I should say function capability - the number of buttons is the same - which gives immediate access to five or so "most used" settings without having to go into the menues - of which there are several.

The TZ3 keeps the Mega Optical Image Stabilization and adds Intelligent ISO, increases the sensitivity without adding noise,(I have not tried the 3200 setting yet.), increases the size of the viewing screen, etc., etc.

The TZ3 is a "well-rounded," and very capable camera.  There is simply no comparison between the TZ1 and the TZ3 as far as the quality of the pictures.  The TZ3 wins hands down.  In my opinion it also beats some big name, higher priced digicams - a couple of which I own - rather handily. 
 
Of course, the big selling point for the TZ3 is still the 10X lens - now with wide angle capability - on a pocket-sized point and shoot camera.  This lens is SHARP, and combined with larger sensor and the new processor yields some excellent results.

While there are no manual controls, per se, the camera seems to do very well without them.  Pictures are sharp, exposures seem nicely done (haven't tried it at night yet, but low light forrest shots were excellent), colors were accurate, appropriately saturated, and vivid (OK.  I like the vivid setting.), good contrast, etc.  There are a variety of AF settings, settable focal points, and focus modes.  There is also exposure compensation, and exposure bracketing available - and they work well!  The live histogram is a welcome bonus.  The TZ3 focuses down to about 2 inches in macro mode - again with excellent, sharp results.  The TZ3 is very well speced out.  

One nice thing that is gone is the lens cap on the TZ1.  It was  really not to inconvenient, but seemed always to be swinging in the wind to add yet another source of camera shake.  The TZ3 lens includes an built in lens cover.  Very welcome.

I currently own five top flight digicams (including this one), and have owned about that many others, I am most impressed with this one - for combined convenience and results.  It is a quantum step forward.

I also have a couple of quite nice, and fairly complete DSLR kits.  They are wonderful, and in a class by themselves, but when I want very nice pictures and the convenience of a pocketable point and shoot with a 10X, wide angle lens, or a back up for the DSLRs, the TZ3 is now my camera of choice.

I went to Ritz Camera today and took a good look at the TZ3. I'll tell you, its pretty nice. The build quality is really  good, as a previous person mentioned. The body is metal. The dials and buttons click with precision, and have a nice resistance. It has a nice weight to it.

I took some nice shots in the store. I must have clicked off 100 pics. I'm impressed with it. If you want something relatively small, powerful and tough, this camera is for you. The 10x zoom is great, but on such  a small camera it is difficult to hold it steady enough(at least for me) to use the zoom too much. 

I love the build quality and style, so I may be biased. It's a nice piece of equipment. I cannot speak to the photo quality only having seen pics on the camera's LCD

I have not yet used an FZ30 or FZ50, but I think this thing beats the pants off an FZ5 or FZ10 as far as image quality is concerned. Really nice camera. Has a nice dSLR type feel. 71% of people that check out the FZ20 here actually end up buying the FZ7, (as of today) but I do not believe the IQ of the FZ7 could hold a candle to that of the FZ20. Buyers may be on the *more megapixel* bandwagon. You can do a lot with 5 megapixels. 

I have found that the IQ of the FZ20 is very close to that of a dSLR

I love this camera.  I have now traveled all over the USA, some places in Europe, and will be using it in China.  Lens is excellent.  I wish it were lighter weight, but can't have everything.  And this weight has certainly no been a problem given its zoom.  I have had this camera for over two years now and have no desire to switch to anything else

I have used the camera for three months, and absolutely love it! The pictures are crisp (even very close-ups), and the video feature is right up there. Sound pick-up is excellent. I have created two DVD's combining videos and still pictures. Folks have thought the quality was very good.

The battery life was rated very good, and I have found this to be true. I carry the camera with me nearly everywhere I go. People are impressed with the size.

Drawbacks? Because of its size, there are no connections from the camera to a computer, TV or battery charger. The docking station is small and lightweight. Because of the battery life, I have never been away from home long enough to need recharging.

I recommend the camera without reservations, and will look first to Casio in the future

I have many traditional film SLRs including the original Pentax K1000 (fully manual), Canon Rebel XOS and a Canon Elph. When considering digital SLR cameras the Canon Digital Rebel and  the point-and-shoot Canon Digital Elph were at the top of my list. But at $150 less than the Canon Digital Elph, the Casio Exilim  EX-S series is a better buy with the the same features (and in some cases a better execution of the same features). If you're looking for a fun point-and-click camera that will record audio, AVI movie files and digital pictures this is it. It takes about 15 miuntes to read the manual and you're off taking pictures. Pay attention when reading the manual and everything else will seem very intuitive.
Of all the cameras I have I use this one most often. 

Other users have complained about the proprietary lithium ion battery but 3rd party equivalents are available right here on the amazon site, you just have to look. My back-up battery was only [...] bucks. San Disk 1GB memory cards are cheap too, [...] online, [...] retail. Last, I agree with many users that a lock switch needs to be developed so that you can keep the camera from accidentally turning on when it's in your pocket -- but remember many cameras have this problem/lack/this feature. I solved my own issues by buying a [...] case with a belt loop

Reasons to buy it:

1. Cheap, a mere $140.
2. Packed with features. From complete auto mode (point and shoot) to fully manual mode. 4MP and 3X optical zoom good enough for most situations.
3. Picture quality is good. It's better than the other two cameras I own (Olympus C720 UZ and Sony DSC S600).
4. Compact. It's smaller than it looks in the stock photo.
5. Fast. Switches on and is ready for the first shot within about 1.5 seconds.


Other things I liked about the camera:

 - Good ergonomics. Fits nicely in my hand, all the buttons are well placed and easy to access. I can even switch on the camera and take pictures with one hand.
 - Powerful flash. Enough to fill up a moderate size room.
 - Great video mode with sound. It also comes with an audio video cable so that you can connect the camera to your TV and watch the vidoes and pictures on your TV.
 - LCD is decent size and is fairly bright, which means it's even visible outdoors in the daytime.


Things I didn't like about the camera:

 - Manual could be more detailed. There is a bsaic manual and sort of a quick start guide. But there was no 40 page booklet which explained each and every feature in detail.
 - The auto focus illuminator (for help in focussing in low light) is a little bright and can be annoying sometimes. But the upside is that you get good focus even in really low light conditions.
 - Does not come with a battery charger. I bought rechargeable batteries and a charger separately.


I have owned the Olympus C720 UZ and the newer Sony DSC S600, but I think this camera is better than both of them.

I bought this camera in August. It is really well made and the controls are easy to navigate. I think it takes really good pictures, inside and outside. Who cares about video quality? Its a Camera, not a camcorder,lady. I think it is a really nice camera. Its really durable too. And it looks nice. I would buy it again. I researched a bunch of cameras before this one and I chose the Sony in the end. Its one step up from just taking everyday pictures. They look really pro. I'd buy it again

I really enjoy this small, high quality camara. I purchased a 2.0 GB memory disk so I could take advantage of the 7.1 mega pixel.And I get great pix everytime.  I have lots of fun with it. Since its so small, it's easy to take everywhere with me. I also get lots of compliments on it's "Fashionable" sleek design.  I highly recomend his camera.

This is enough of an instrument to show you new things in the sky for years to come. It is sturdy and simple to operate. It has enough light-gathering power (more important than magnification) to reveal dim star clusters, nebulae, and galaxies and good enough optics to show you the surface of planets like Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars.

Some advice on selection. Dobsonians like this one come in a range of sizes. A 114mm (4 ?") is a bit on the small side but still a fine instrument, especially if your ability to carry large objects is limited. A 150-200mm (6-8") scope is right in the middle of the recommended range. A 250mm (10") like this one is on the big side, and you should buy one only if you are able-bodied.

Some advice on use. Viewing through a telescope is less like playing a CD and more like playing a guitar. Finding objects takes a little bit of practice. The 9x50mm "crosshair" finder supplied with this scope is great for fine searching, but I recommend supplementing it with a red-dot finder to aid in initial pointing. You will also need to buy an atlas (Sky &amp; Telescope's Pocket sky Atlas is the best available), a red flashlight to view the charts without blowing out your badly-needed night vision, and a guidebook to lead you to interesting objects. These investments will greatly add to your enjoyment.

What more can I say? This is the kind of scope that experienced observers have been trying to steer novices towards for decades. Although, I recommend that you do your homework before buying any scope--learn the sky and get to know experienced stargazers who can advise you--when it comes time to purchase, you could hardly do better than this scope.

For more advice, see my encyclopedic guide here on Amazon, "So you want to buy a telescope.

I've had a ton of these, and I take them on camping trips with kids where the main activity is playing in big mud fields.  I've had them in my pocket while rolling around in the mud, taken it out, shot a few pics, put it back in the pocket with no problem.  (See pictures for examples of "mud photos")

A couple of times I've had them stand up to so much moisture and abuse that the cardboard falls off, but still had beautiful pictures every time, no jams or over-exposures.  

I've found the two pack at WalMart on sale for $8.99 a couple of times, and you absolutely cannot be that deal. 

This is my favorite disposable camera, and I've tried them all.

High ISO and large screen were the reasons for my purchase. The screen is great but, when you force the ISO 1600, it seems to darken the pictures more than in 800. I have a S5200 and that one seems to adjust other options like white balance much better when an ISO is set w/o having to go to full Manual option. Definitely something to improve! The auto option seems to work much better and I was surprised with how good the high speed three frame shooting works. Also, the two picture function(it takes two with slightly different sets automatically) saves me on a lot of 're-posing

First of all I would like to say that I was very reluctant to buy a SONY camera. After doing a lot of research for my needs I ended up with Canon 800IS and Sony's new toy T100. Ofcourse canon has the best overall ratings for ever but I wanted a stylish looking camera for my needs. Sony T100 is the best looking camera I have seen. It's features are awesome compared to it's small size. You can take it everywhere. Big bright screen on the back clearly visible in bright sunlight. It takes good indoor pictures too. I tried to play with its settings for while and thought that camera was not good. But then the best feature of the camera made it a winner for me. The auto mode takes great pictures and no need to set anything. Sometimes changing auto ISO helped to reduce the graniness but to be very honest if you are not going to blow the image to larger sizes (which would be 99% of the time atleast for me) it won't make difference. Just Point and Shoot. You get a perfect image for viewing on computers. No complaints apart from optional docking station which costs about $80. 5x optical zoom is boon to me as 3x was merely zoom. Also zomming while taking movies makes this a small camcoder with 640x480 30fps shooting.

It doesn't have touch screen like T50 and so it's responsiveness is better. I would like it bit faster though. Also camera takes pictures at very fast rate and the first picture you take is less than 2 secs.

I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who can afford it.

This is a camcorder for the digital age. Tiny, multi-functional, and flexible. No ancient-technology magnetic tape. As with any product on the leading edge, there are many shortcomings.

Let's dispense with the obvious. This device is all about compact go-anywhere flexibility and ease. For best image quality, a dedicated mini-DV camcorder and dedicated digital still camera is the only way to go. In fact, buying a separate camcorder and still camera may likely be less expensive than the Sanyo C6 while resulting in superior quality.

Overall image quality is best described as "OK". The poor lens zoom and aperture is more befitting a $100 digital camera than a $400 device. The flash is weak and will not light many scenes that any other still camera would light. In addition, since the flash is not offset in any way from the lens, red-eye is virtually guaranteed at any range. This is not a problem with digital touch-up being common practice, but plan on touching up more often. Low light conditions drag down image quality dramatically in video mode. Virtually any digital camcorder at any price will outperform this Sanyo in video mode in any situation, but a little day light goes a long way towards improving video quality with the Xacti C6. Also, to be clear, the video quality is still superior to anything seen in the best of analog camcorders.

For all these negatives, the convenience can be truly revolutionary. One can wear the tiny VPC-C6 around the neck all day. This causes an amazing change in attitude towards video. Since the Sanyo is so compact, no one would think twice about bringing it along on any minor travel. Being freed from the chore of "packing up" a camcorder  means a corresponding willingness to bring the Sanyo on so many more occasions, such as a visit to the park instead of just weddings and birthday parties. And whereas a mini-DV camcorder requires one hour to transfer one hour's worth of video to your computer, the Sanyo transfers video as fast as the SD card and USB 2.0 interface will allow. That means five minutes or less to transfer one hour's worth of video to a computer. This ease increases willingess to create video and share video. No more procrastination over dragging out the camcorder wiring and the manual task of initiating video transfer to a computer. With the Sanyo, just place the camera in the docking station and pictures and video files are available just like files on a USB flash drive. It is difficult to overestate the significance of this convenience. Video becomes an everyday pleasure, if one so wishes, rather than a special occasion chore. If one values this convenience over absolute image quality, this is the product to own.

This is a leading edge product. To get the most of this product, I highly recommend doing the following:
1) Sanyo has provided an updated firmware on their website. This fixes a fatal flaw in the audio processing that some people have noted as excessive distortion - this update makes audio quality competitive with other camcorders. In addition, this firmware update adds compatability with 4gb SD cards (the limit is 2gb without the update). Kudos to Sanyo for the continuing support. (Note that the instructions are a littled distorted in the translation - what they meant to write is that you need to push the SET button to the LEFT to enter the firmware update screen.)
2) The video is in MP4 format and is playable only with Quicktime. For Windows users, this limits video editing to the included programs or Quicktime-specific programs. There is an easy solution. First, download the Divx codec (a freeware commercial product) or Xvid codec (a free open source product - my preference) or ffdshow (a free open source product) - use your search engine of choice to find these. Second, download a utility called "MP4CAM2AVI" (a free open source software found easily with your search engine of choice). With these two programs, the video becomes compatable with any Windows program, including just about any media player (such as Windows Media Player) and any video editing tool (such as Windows Movie Maker).

I look forward to seeing how this market segment evolves. The freedom from bulk and digital tedium is addicting and I am sure the image quality will continue to improve. For now, I am happy capturing the memories that would have otherwise been lost had I continued to own a conventional bulky tape-based camcorder

It's pretty hard to argue against this at the prices we're seeing...

In short, for not so much more than the high end of the bridge cameras (Panasonic DMC-FZ50, Fuji S9100) you can have this camera with the 2 kit lenses. I imagine that you'll be very satisfied for paying the difference.

8MP with 2 pretty good kit lenses for under $650 as of 4/2007, and an upgrade path to the E-510 for all the lenses and accessories. Once you make that upgrade, what's left to ask for except a faster burst mode and weather sealing. That's 10MP, IS in-body, SSWF and live-view.

IMHO, even if you're an "entry-level" DSLR user, spend the extra $400+ and get the faster 14-54mm f2.8-3.5 lens and get rid of the the 14-45mm f3.5-5.6 lens. The 40-150mm f3.5-4.5 is a very nice lens, with no real peers in the entry-level DSLR range as a kit lens that I could see without going 3rd party. This lens put Olympus over the edge for me. For that speed of lens over that 35mm equivalent range (28-300mm), I'm not sure what else can compete on price. 
If you have to have a faster lens for the longer zoom, you could cough up the $800+ for the 50-200mm f2.8-3.5, and even then, that's a very, very good price for that kind of lens and 35mm equivalent range.

The camera has full manual controls, as expected from a DSLR, and can drive a newbie like me nuts, but can also keep it simple with it's auto mode and numerous scene settings (which I use a good deal).

If you get this camera, IMHO, don't bother with the xD cards. They are very slow in comparison to the less expensive CF cards in this camera.

When it comes time to get a flash, go the extra mile and get the Olympus FL-36 over the FL-20. I'm not sure that the FL-50's warranted at this price point. I was lucky to find one cheap, so I didn't have to research 3rd party flashes.

I confess to having been a pixel-peeper and compared the high-ISO samples from this camera to the Canons and Nikons of the world. It's definitely not bad in direct comparison, but after you're done resizing and touching up the photos, you'll never notice, IMHO. On the down side, the RAW files (.ORF) don't seem to be compressed, and they're not exactly small at 14MB.

All in all, not much to complain about here

I don't like pink so I bought the blue bag.  I had bought a black one, but it was so skimpy I returned it and prayed until this one arrived. I had no trouble with Amazon crediting me for the return, either.  It was so cute!  I'm too old for "cute," but I kept it because I needed a case for my new HP R717.  It is small, yet padded enough to trust that your camera will be cushioned if you drop it.  I have dropped my camera and it was not injured.  It has a little pouch inside to store an extra battery for my camera, not the big AA batteries, but the flat type that come with my R717.  I recommend this little bag, or the pink one, even if you don't like pink...or blue.  They are well cushioned and snug, but not too snug you think they will tear.  The are sturdy and have nice shoulder straps and magnet closures

I bought this camera to take pictures of my sons playing basketball.  My other camera shot dark grainy pictures indoor.  I have had a lot of success with this and really nice outdoor shots as well.  What I just started playing with, and I love is the video feature.  It is so easy to use and the images are better than I expected.  I bought this camera in December as a present to myself and I have used it constantly and recharged the battery twice.  This is major to me as my Nikon was devouring batteries in an afternoon.  The optical zoom is clean, but the digital is definitely noisy. I have had fun shooting pictures of my kids because the shutter speed is so quick and I don't miss the shot.

This camera is very similar to the Fuji F30, but has face detection (fd) that autofocuses on faces in a photo.  Great for taking pictures of yourself, or for snapshots you don't have time to compose.  Excellent quality photos in dim light. At 3200 ISO, photos are washed out and noisy, but still good for capturing an image you would otherwise miss. Option to limit ISO to 1600, or to 400. Camera will use any speed up to the limit. 400 ISO is extremely good. As good as my Canon Digital Rebel xti. Usual modes I never use (flower, landscape, etc.), but one unique mode I use all the time: no flash/flash. The camera takes a picture without flash up to 3200 ISO, and then takes a picture with flash immediately after. Usually takes less than one second to capture both images. No flash doesn't surprise anyone and ruin the candid shot, while the following flash guarantees you'll get the image, even if the "warm glow of candlelight" is ruined. I always have the camera set to this mode. Uses xD cards, which I hate, but if you buy a 1 GB card you'll be able to take 400 - 500 photos without ever needing to change the card. Also, battery life is unbelieveable! Fully charge the camera over several hours, and you'll be able to take 400 photos, half with flash, before the battery is drained. Fuji-brand underwater housing is optional, watertight to 40m (121 ft.) Camera comes with underwater setting to intensify non-blue colours, and still keep the intense blue of the water. Literally *every* diver should have one of these cameras. I recommend this camera without hesitation. There simply isn't anything else like it on the market.

Combine the high ISO, low noise and fast shutter speed for great blur free shots on low light AND MOVING SUBJECTS. This is what only Fuji can offer to you on compact camera class.

The F31fd doesn't have IS (Image stabilized lenses or a CCD shift sensor), which other cameras use to reduce the effect of blur from camera shaking. But this kind of stabilization is really only useful for 6x or more zoom, for just 3x typical zoom on ultra compact P&amp;S you just need to hold it firmly and will get the same results.

IS also can't prevent blur from moving subjects. With a High ISO like on F31fd you can use faster shutter speeds that will freeze subjects and prevent blur from camera shaking too. 

Fuji Super CCD sensor provides the lowest noise on High ISO you will find on 2007's compact cameras, the quality is only comparable to the big DSLR professional cameras.

Ah, and the Face Detection is not just a gimmick or marketing appeal... it's really great, specially if someone who doesn't know how to focus on the face then recompose the scene is taking pictures of you, with F31fd they will not miss the shot

I got a pair of these for Christmas. Initially, I was skeptical about the quality of an inexpensive roof-prism optic, and this isn't my favorite brand name either. But contrary to my expectations, I've been extremely impressed with them so far.

Good brightness, contrast, sharpness, field of view, and close focus all exceeded my expectations for a binocular at this price point. Feel, fit and finish are all very good.

I wear eyeglasses, and these binoculars still deliver a nice wide view through the eyepiece. The twist-down eyecups are quick to extend / retract if you are sharing these with someone who doesn't wear glasses.

They come with a decent carry case, and relative to porro-prism types, the weight and compactness are both a little bit better.

If you are looking for a good binocular for birding or general use, I highly recommend you take a look through these in addition to the other popular models. I think these really hit the sweet spot for price / size / weight / performance, and I'm very happy with them

My bother-in-law and I went to Africa on safari last year. We had purchased the binoculars especially to use while hunting. The optics were good and we were initially impressed by the image stabilization while still here in the states. Our impressions were confirmed when our professional hunters fell in love with them during the hunt. They were so impressed by the IS and price that we left a pair with our hunter. He used them for the entire season last year, and when he visited "The States" last month, he reported that they are still doing well

The ergonomics: Perfect. The D200 is not completely rubber-encased. There's rubber where your hands need to hold it, and plastic where your hands rarely touch it. The hand grip is comfortable and nicely concave where the tips of your fingers can dig in.

The battery door and the memory card door are made of plastic, and hinge-pinned. A simple slide latch opens the battery door....and some have warned the latch could be easily (accidentally) tripped. The memory card door latch, however, uses a more secure 45 degree pivoting latch.

USB 2 and Video Out/DC-in doors are made of flexible rubber, and these doors extend into the body of the camera as the hinges themselves.

The English language operating manual is a work of art. Each operating concept is alpha' &amp; numerically numbered at the pictoral diagram, and to the page where the function is explained in perfect English. The reader will quickly catch on to how this well thought out manual is organized. 

I like the depth of field preview, the mirror lock-up, and the multiple-exposure capability. 

The continuous servo autofocus does a better job than any human at following and focusing on any moving object. 

If you have the old manual-focus, film-based Nikon SLR lenses from the '70's and '80's, except for a few rare exceptions, will fit on the D200.

All these positive attributes remind me of the best, most highly-evolved film camera SLR's. No wonder so many photographers have been won over to digital media.

I have the white one (black was unavailable at the time of purchase)

1.  The camera will not slide out even though the clasp is magnet. It is made snug enough that the felt holds it in the case even with a shake or jostle.

2.  Durable. No scrapes or scratches in 7 months.

3.  Haven't missed the belt clip option, its small enough to fit in my pocket

4.  Well constructed/durable.  People think its some sort of iPod case/holder

The picture is fine at this price.

I bought the Panasonic VDR-D100 for my daughter because she usually doesn't want to do anything with the computer like edit video. When we gave it to her the first thing she asked was, "can I edit the movies?" 

I did a quick test to make sure the DVDs would finalize and work on another DVD player with success on 3 computers and 3 DVD players. I didn't find anything the disc wouldn't play on.

Then I started up Vegas Movie Studio Platinum which I use to edit my miniDV movies. I selected IMPORT from DVD and it went straight to the miniDVD and loaded in the files where I was able to edit and add titles, music, sound effects and a voice over if I wanted to. 

Since I already bought DVD-R/W discs she will be able to reuse them if she ever edits the movies because you can unfinalize the discs and reformat them.

I did a lot of research before buying this camera.  We could have bought a higher quality digital camcorder for less or higher quality MiniDV camcorder for the same price.  What led to our final decision to purchase this camcorder was the fact we could record straight to a 8cm DVD-R, finalize the disc on the camcorder, and play it directly on our DVD player or DVD-ROM player on our computer.  We didn't want to deal with sticking cables and wires into the TV, electrical outlet, and camera to playback footage.  And we also didn't want to deal with the cost and trouble of transferring footage onto DVDs to keep in our video library for the future.

For those of you who like to edit, re-record, create effects, etc., you need to purchase special software separately, but with a DVD-RAM disc, you have the ease and convenience of doing it all from your DVD-ROM on your computer.  You can also download it with the USB cable, but it is nice to be able to just pop it in the DVD drive and get started.  

If you are only interested in playback, DVD-R discs are sufficient; however, you can't erase or record over footage on DVD-Rs, only DVD-RW and DVD-RAM discs.  

The picture quality of the camera is adequate.  It isn't grainy, but smooth and actually very nice in the right lighting, especially outside on a sunny day.  It doesn't have a built-in light, so you have to be aware of the right surroundings and environment for recording.  I would give the picture quality a 3.75 out of 5.  If you want better quality, you will need to buy a more expensive DVD Camcorder.  Considering how far we have come over the years with home video technology, it definitely beats those days images were out of focus and grainy.  You can't compare it to TV and movie camera quality, but I think it is pretty darn good for home videos.  The zoom is good, but of course it takes some time to focus if you zoom in or out too quickly.  The stabilizer is pretty good, but I keep it off for the most part to get better picture quality.  If you plan to move around a lot, use the function, but expect to lose a little quality in the process.  What basically happens when using the stabilizer (with most cameras, I believe) is that the image movements are slightly delayed.  The sound quality is adequate, but if you are recording when it is windy, you will pick up a lot of the wind sounds unless you block the microphone with your hand.

The only problem I have had so far is with the discs.  We bought Panasonic DVD-RW discs and can't get them to play on our computer or in our DVD player.  We ended up purchasing Sony DVD-R discs and they play with no problem.  When I called Panasonic about their DVD-RW discs, they didn't have a good answer.  The representative told me to make sure the DVD-RW discs are compatible with my players.  I told her they may not be compatible with my DVD Player, but it should be with my new computer software.  The representative just repeated herself and eventually said there isn't any difference between Sony and Panasonic discs (interesting).  They make the claim that Panasonic discs work the best in the manual, but now I know better.

Overall, this camcorder is a great value (you can't beat the price for this DVD technology), average to good quality picture and functions, is excellent for the ease and convenience of DVD playback and storage, and is really easy to use.

I agree with many of the reviewers--in the mid range and wide angle the lens is superb, but it is not quite as sharp as a tele--as one of the reviewers said--it does many things, and not all of them perfectly--the lens is a compromise, but an excellent compromise--the VR is an added boost--
I'm still debating whether or not to keep it or send it back, because of the weakness in the tele-- but there is nothing else that can replace its versatility.--I don't want to keep changing lenses

Pros: Compact and complete, this portable lighting studio offers flexibility with it's reversible backdrop (gray/blue). I also have used the black back panel for some shots as well. Construction quality is good ( I found one of my cats sleeping on the top panel, which is fabric and held in place with Velcro tabs), sturdy enough for its intended purpose. I like the output of the lights--seems to be a broad spectrum similar to daylight.

Cons: Only one complaint: The output of the lights could be stronger. Requires a tripod to gain depth of field with a smaller aperture

The Bushnell Perma Focus 7x50 Wide Angle Binoculars were the ideal choice for my recent trip to Tanzania and the Serengeti. They worked perfectly for the application needed. A really happy surprise on just how well these worked. As we bounced around on dirt roads and cross country in Land Rovers, the Perma Focus feature was outstanding and made things simple and easy! :-) The magnification level was perfect for almost every scenario we came across. Anything that was outside of about 80 feet came through in crystal clear vivid color and clarity. It really made for up close and personal viewing of all the animals we saw. By far, these were the best investment I made before the trip! I can't imagine being without them now on such an expedition. Really fantastic performance and a great value to boot!!!! The vendor was fast &amp; flawless in the transaction too. In my opinion you won't be disappointed with these binoculars. Troy :-)

One of the reviews I read before purchasing these suggested that the reviewer should've had them for her Celine Dion concert.  I took the suggestion and they were perfect!  They fit nicely in my evening bag and brought Celine closer to me as I sat in the Second Mezzanine at Caesar's Palace!  Not only that - but the price was right! I couldn't be happier!  Plus, now I have them for our next trip to Rocky Mountain Park to get up close and personal to some wildlife

Nikon has always been the leader in photography/ camera/ lenses.  Others have nobly tried but a Nikon remains the high bar that others only hope to reach.

When the shift from film to digital began, there was some speculation if Nikon could keep up with the competition.  Well, rest assure that not only have they kept up, they continue to lead the way.  The latest example of this is the D200.

Like the D70/ D80 - this is a solid piece of equipment.  Just the feel of it tells you that you are holding an excellent piece of technology.  But the proof will always be in the end results and again, the combination of the Nikon know-how and Nikon lenses lead even a beginner to come up with excellent pictures.

Gone is the "lag between shots".  You can fire up and shoot multiple pictures in seconds so action shots are all yours.  Without even "tweaking" a picture with a computer program, you can print top of the line photos at home.  

People have cited the cons:  Expensive.  Yes.  The camera does come with a hefty price tag but it should be kept in mind that this is a piece of machinery intended for serious photographers.  If you are a "vacation and holiday" picture taker, then you should elect to buy a cheaper camera.  The same is true with the difficulty of the multitude of small buttons, dials and switches.  There are too many and they can be overwhelming but only to someone who is in the "point and shoot" school of picture taking.  Anyone else will relish the options that Nikon has provided us with on the D200.

Room for improvement?  Well, the battery life is nowhere near as good as the D70 which I upgraded from but that is a weak complaint as you can still get hundreds of shots on one charge.  Also, it would be a boon if the flash would automatically pop up when needed like in former models.

So if you are serious about photography and always have one at the ready, this is the one for you

Overall its a fine viewer however it has a couple of problems.

#1) it would be really nice if there was a way to copy pictures off of a SD card and into memory and vice versa. This would be invaluable for moving pictures around without having to hook things up to a computer.

#2) hooking it up to a computer is a pain, instructions are not helpful. If you are using the viewer to look at images off of SD cards in remote places (ie trailcamera) it works fine, but I'd like the ability to move pictures off of a card into the viewers internal memory so I can leave the card with the trailcamera.

#3 this is nasty, if you cycle through the pictures too fast you can "crash" the viewer. Upon resetting it, it will say there are no pictures found on the memory card. Powering off, swapping cards wont help it read. The pictures are still there however but you need to then access the card directly through a computer to extract. Reformat the card and it will be fine with the reader.

For what I use it for I like it even though it has quirks that must be worked around.

I purchased this camera 2 weeks ago.
I love using it.
It has lots of function to play with. It is easy to use.
I didnt have trouble taking good pictures in zoom mode outdoor.
Indoor, I had to use tripod if i use zoom.
However, i cant really think of any occasion that i have to use zoom indoor other than my testing last week.
Besides, it gives great pictures and I loved the price. I kind of considered DSLR camera but I gave it up becasue lenses were more expensive than camera itself. I considered one wide angle lense and one zoom lense. It would have cost me almost 2000 dollars
So far, I love this camera.
If this helps to anyone considering buying this camera, Id give two thumbs up.

Excellent image quality with superb 18X optical zoom with optical stabilization, but no high speed USB and mediocre software

Images from this camera are very high quality.  The 18X optical zoom is very usable with only minimal distortion noticeable at the extremes.  The optical image stabilization system (based on stabilizing the CCD image sensor instead of lens elements) is quite good and performed well under several different circumstances (moving car, boat, shaky hands).  

My main gripe with this camera is the lack of high speed USB 2.0 support.  The fine print says that the USB interface is "full speed" which means a maximum transfer rate of 12 Mbit/s instead of the 480 Mbit/s possible with high speed USB.  So, downloading photos from the camera through the USB interface is painfully slow compared to most current generation digital cameras such as a Canon SD900.  

The software provided with the camera is somewhat difficult to use and is slow and unresponsive.

It would also be desirable if the camera could accept a lithium ion rechargeable battery in addition or instead of the 4 AA batteries it uses.  But, battery life with both alkaline and rechargeable NiMH AA batteries was adequate.

To All,

I just purchased the SP-550UZ after searching for the best camera bang for the buck - Olympus fills the bill..... 3/3/07 was my first day of use and I decided to check ALL the features - with the batteries supplied - still in use and a 2GB card - I took off for the outdoors and began shooting pictures at a local park - 300 pictures - including several 15 FPS and 30 FPS shoots and  three videos - 15, 30 and 45 seconds in length.

I am not a pro and will be using this camera for Sports, vacations and every day family events.

No Cons yets - I love the "SCN" feature - just select how you want to take the picture and the camera setups the camera - all you have to do is take the picture

I got this camera for my birthday present in January and I'm extremely satisfied.  I'm very new to the entire "photography world", however this camera makes it easy to get into.  The camera is smaller than I expected, however it takes great pictures.  I use it often for pictures while we are on trips.  The picture quality is great, however screen quality isn't up-to-par with other brands.  This is a great value and I really like it.  My only complaint is that the Easyshare software is bad.  It's slow, outdated, and doesn't work well overall.  I recommend getting a 1 GB SD card.  I have 3 of them

I've been using 35mm SLR cameras for over 30 years. For the last 9 or 10 years I have gone through several under $400 digital cameras as the technology has improved. This Kodak Z710 is a very economical compromise.  The built-in 10X optical zoom is a great feature.  
The Z710 does not have image stabilization (IS)as do some of the more expensive models but if you have a moderately steady hand and you press the shutter button rather than pound it (and the whole camera!) that's not really a problem.  
Another feature of this camera that I really appreciate is the manual settings position which allows much more creative control of a shot. Check out the Kodak web site for more information on this.  
I bought this camera from an Amazon dealer for less than $200 shipped to me.  That's cheaper than a reconditioned unit (same model!) recently sold on eBay

I made the decision to buy this camera based on the many very positive user reviews.  It replaces a six year old 2.1 megapixel camera.  I am not disappointed.  Amazon's price is very good for a 7.1 megapixel camera with a boatload of features.  It is also considerably lighter in weight than the older camera.    

Later I read reviews by experts who give it only mediocre scores for picture quality.  They criticize it for no image stabilization leading to blur (especially at higher power zoom) and "noise" at film speeds over 100 ASA.  I set up a couple of situations in which both problems should have been very apparent.  Then I enlarged smaller portions of the frames to print inexpensive 4 x 6 test photos.  Had I printed the full frame, the print would have been larger than an 8 x 10.  I just do not see the problems the experts criticize.  The colors are rich and vibrant.

I really appreciate the wide range of controls.  The user can choose a from a number of modes fitted to various situations.  These result in a faster shutter speed, or more depth of field, or fill-in flash, etc.  It is not necessary to memorize the tiny icons on the selector dial.  An on-screen prompt tells you what each mode does.  I also like the amount of control in the manual mode.  The user can choose the ASA rating, shutter speed, apeture opening, and electronic flash mode.  The manual tells how to set the camera for special situations, like photographing documents.  When you take the picture, the through the lens screen goes black for part of a second.  You know the picture has been taken, unlike a camera with an optical finder.  

The camera is very intuitive for first time use.  I also read most of the manual on-line while waiting for delivery and handled the camera several times in a local discount store.

When I first installed the software I restarted the computer, but it repeatedly would not recognize the camera.  I switched to another USB cord and it worked fine immediately.  Then it also began to work with the original USB cord.  I had even checked for a loose connection.  Who knows what that was about!

One little thing to keep in mind is this.  If the camera is set on continuous auto focus, you can aim and shoot.  If it is set on one-time auto focus, you must press the shutter halfway down and wait for the green light before shooting, if you want sharp pictures.  I do not know, but expect the difference is battery life.

A 1 GB memory card can store 485 pictures at the 7.1 megapixel resolution

This 10-20mm lens is equivalent to a 15-30mm in a 35mm film camera, so it's an ultra-wide lens at 10mm. I was pleasantly surprised at how sharp the images are from this lens; and it's rectilinear, which means that straight lines in real life remain straight in the photograph. It is a well-made lens, made with high-grade materials. What this lens excels at is when you want to photograph sweeping landscapes, close-quarters interior photography, and in architectural photography where you don't mind the exaggerated converging lines that an ultrawide produces. Personally, that's what I like, so I'm very happy with this Sigma 10-20mm

Not only is this beauty wide, I have found the lens is very sharp to on my D200! It is built solid and focus's fast, and I don't have any problem with distortion because I use DXO Optics software and it cleans it up automaticly! Buy this lens, it is cheap for what you get

I've been using the Sigma 10-20mm about twice or three times a month and I am very pleased. At such a wide angle, you will most like need to "de-fish" your final shot which can be remedied with CS2 or some other image processing software. At 10-20mm, the range is almost too wide, but after further usage, I got used to it. I'm very accustomed to a 12-24mm range and the 10-20mm took a lot of getting used to. The only drawbacks I know of in using this lens is that it is really prone to flare (despite the marketing by Sigma stating that the new lens coating diminishes flare) and the biggest aperture is f/4 which is variable pending on the focal length. It is not a fixed aperture lens. I also find that this lens is at it's sharpest around f/8-f/11 and I wouldn't go beyond that because I started noticing the degrading of image quality at very small apertures with this lens. But other than that, I've been pretty satisfied for the price I paid for this ultra wide angle lens. I still would prefer Nikon's 12-24mm, but I'm not willing to shell out that much money on a wide angle lens. Sigma's price for their 10-20mm is acceptable

Shooting with a dslr is great in a lot of ways, but the sensor crop kills my wide-angle capability, which, to me, is absolutely awful!

Personally, I hate zoom lenses. I've got a full set of Nikon primes. And while I'd prefer a prime lens, these zoom lenses are the only game in town for wide angle on crop sensor dslr.

I like this lens because it goes WIDE on digital. I suggest you buy this lens for the 10mm and keep it at 10mm because the 10mm wide end is really where it's at and the reason to buy this lens over the alternatives.

For anybody considering 10mm vs 12mm at the wide end, unless you mostly use the narrower end of the focal length most of the time, 2mm is a SIGNIFICANT difference in field of view on short lenses. As the focal length increases (eg, from 400mm to 600mm), the difference in angle of view is not very large. But the difference between 10mm is 12mm even though "only 2mm" is no laughing matter, and if you don't believe me, you can do a comparison in a camera shop to prove it to yourself.

If you end up deciding to get a 12mm, you want to buy the sigma 12mm (I think it is 12-24mm?) because that lens covers full 35mm frame (and the angle of view has got to be absolutely amazing)!

Also, if Sigma or Nikon reads this review, please make an 8mm or 9mm f2.8 rectilinear crop sensor prime!

And if Sigma reads this review, I want some f1.2 or f1.0 AFD primes! 50mm for film maybe even a digital sensor version in some medium range focal length! I would definitely buy (full frame coverage of course) a mid length and a medium wide angle and a short tele! Neither Nikon nor Canon makes anything like that (well, canon kind of does/did), so you'd have the market segment dominated

I have been shooting away for the last few weeks.  The Olympus 720 is a gem.  I must have filled up my card 3-4 times so far.  Being new to the digital camera era, I am finding that it is not as hard as I thought it would be.  Shoot, pop the card into the card reader, copy to computer, upload to Walmart's photo service, and I have my prints mailed to my house in a few days.  I am happy that everything was included with the kit.  I would have never known what I needed and it basically has everything covered

This is a cool implimentation of a much needed device for those with D200s. The camera loves batteries. Having two is good!  Having the ability to watch one drain and knowing there's another on standbye is a fine feeling. Knowing that there are two more batteries in the case waiting is even better! For a full day of shooting, you need this and some serious memory. Highly recommended. Also handles AAs... always good in field conditions

I have been using this scope on the beach at night to monitor sea turtle nesting. When up close, the image is excellent, but not so good for far away (more than 100-200 ft). Very easy to use, and the fact that it's waterproof is a plus (haven't dropped it in the ocean yet!). You can't really get a feel for how good the image is in a residential area, but out on the beach, with the moonlight, it rocks. Most of the time I don't even need the IR illuminator. To save power, turn it off, and it will still provide an image with the available light for almost 5 minutes. If you're looking to see things that are far away, this scope won't work well, but for things that are close by (say, from one end of the backyard to the other) it's a good deal. I put mine in a hard sided padded carrying case, since it gets bounced around on the ATV, and haven't had a problem yet

I just bought this for about $190 at the local PX.  I am impressed so far.  I was going to buy the GS180, but for the sale price I would be crazy to pass this up.
SO far the low light is much better than a single CCD.  The video playback is quiet compared to a few other camcorders that record the motor noise onto the tape.  
I plan on buying an extended battery and a tripod today at the same sale.  
I will use this camcorder mostly for home videos of my son and vacations we take around Europe.  I look froward to using this camcorder a lot

I bought this rangefinder for golf. It is small enough that I could keep it in my pocket. It really helps me with the approach shots to the greens. It takes a bit of experience to be able to focus on the flag. I usually use a person on the green as my target. After I got an approximate read, I use the scan mode to find the exact distance to the flag. Be careful with the tiny battery cover. It came loose and I lost it on the golf course. Fortunately, I recovered it amongst the green grass. The cover is also green. I now put a tape over it to secure the cover.

This rangefinder is great! Much lighter than the big bulky other units. Has all the great features that is needed. This is one that you will take with you and not leave in the truck because it's too big.  I tested this against some of my buddies' bigger units at known distances and this one out did the bigger units in speed and accuracy. Great scan mode. Best buy.  Should be sold for about ($) more than asked for

Took some nice pictures underwater in Cuba. Pretty easy to use. Worked fine at our depth (~8 meters, 24 feet). Still waiting for the chance to use it at greater depths.

Looks exactly as the posted picture except the badge reads "Panasonic", not "Lumix". Fits the camera perfectly. No extra room for memory cards, spare battery, charger, etc. It's easier to insert the camera with both zippers down. The belt loop won't fit most belts. No straps. However, the camera's strap is good enough. Good protection

The changer performs perfectly.  I was surprised that the price was so high for such a simple gadget.  The only other drawback is that the cord is not as long as the original, about one foot shorter.  Other than that, it is fine.  I gave my original changer to my daughter, whose charger died just before leaving the country

The charger really did what it was supposed to do. I have an LI-10B, so I was still some what worried that it wasn't going to do the job, but it did. I also liked that it was small so you can travel with it anywhere.

This item was purchased for Casio Exilim 8 megapixel camera. The quality of this item is strong and durable. The camera is small any ways to take with you anywhere by putting it in your pocket. However, to protect the camera, this case provides outstanding protection and is still small and compact to take it with you anywhere

I bought this camera for my girlfriend and she loves it. It has all the basic functions her older Coolpix had abut more and they're a bit more user friendly. 
Pros: Compact and easy to Hold. I've had a few other Point and Shoots and they feel like they are going to jump out of my hand. This one feels pretty good. 
Cons: Before buying I read the reviews and a few were stating that the focus was not everything it should be. I will agree. That is the cameras only real big down fall. Though my girlfriend may not notice it so much, to me it's a little more aparant.
For the most part, overall I really like this little guy..

This is a really nice compact camera from Canon. The picture quality is excellent. I have tried some night/day shots and the pictures are great. The zoom is the pretty much non existant at 3x however that depends on what you use the camera for. The build quality is excellent and I really love the 3" display. I find the ipod like controls very convenient too though it takes some practice to get used to it. The camera is very compact but I never had problems to get a good grip and a steady hand. The images have excellent true color and are indeed sharp. I would definetely recommend an accessory kit for this camera which includes a nice small leather case and an extra original Canon battery and its available on Amazon. The accessory kit turns out to be cheaper than buying the individual components and its contains original Canon parts especially the extra battery. Also get a SD card with large enough memory. What comes with the camera (32MB) is really a waste. Still don't understand why these camera manufactures throw in such a small memory card. But overall a great easy to use and a smart looking camera that produces wonderful results

Takes great pics and the 3" screen is REALLY nice. Wall plug in recharger is nice also. I have taken pics outside in sunny, overcast, &amp; rainy conditions. Indoors at sporting events and around the house. In all settings the pics have been truly wonderful. A few instances of blurriness caused by an unsteady hand but otherwise very nice pics.

However, as Canon's top of the line Powershot commanding a higher dollar price this camera really should have a higher optical zoom. 3x isnt enough when other, cheaper cameras have 6x optical zoom. Also Image Stabilzation should be included

Works better than I could have hoped.  I have used it for about a month and it is very simple to execute -- but you have to be able to hold somewhat steady which is not a problem for me.  If you are someone who has the shakes -- may be a problem.
  I have compared the accuracy to gps devices with guys playing with me.  This is better since it gives you the actual yardage to the pin.  Also, you can get yardage to another golfer in the field, and yardage to any object, bunker, tree etc., which the gps can't.  
   A lot of courses are not marked correctly, and, of course, yardage changes depending on how far off to the side of the fairway -- or even out of the fairway -- you are.  This is where it is especially nice.  There are times when without this device you are just flat out guessing.
   This is an awesome piece of technology.  It was well worth the price for me.

This digital camera is the best.  I cannot complain about any aspect of it.  It has a huge amount of modes and settings and additional features to add to pictures as you are taking them.  It's small enough to fit into your pocket and not think about it (it's smaller than a wallet).  It takes excellent pictures that come out looking great, all very high quality.  The huge screen makes it easy to view what you are looking at and has great image quality.  The videos are equally good, with great sound and good picture.  It looks better than just about any other digital camera that I have seen.  Even though I said I cannot complain, there are a few things that slightly annoy me occasionally.  The first is that it flashes twice.  Remember to tell this to people before taking their picture!  After the first flash, people tend to look away, and by the time the second flash comes and the picture is taken, the moment is lost.  This only occurs when the camera is set to "AUTO" mode.  I usually press the menu button and choose a mode.  When you do this, the flashes occur very quickly (you barely notice a gap between them).  Some of the features are very useful.  I use the "backlight" mode quite often.  It allows you to take a picture of something even if there is a bright light in the background.  My only other complaint is for those of us with large fingers, the circular button that operates pretty much every feature can be difficult to use (sometimes I push 2 buttons at once, or the complete wrong one).  But everything else that this camera can do cancels it out.  This camera has more features and better quality than many larger and more expensive cameras out there

 While not on the 'highest end' of tripod purchases, this one is a must for anyone owning a HDR-HC1 or other compatable camcorder. Operating the camera from the tripod (rather than the touch screen) provides steady footage for the amatuer videographer. The unit assembles easily and has stable panning and rotation. The only drawback is the soft storage bag which doesn't provide adequate head protection

handy item for price.  not a great telescope, but a very useful tool to look at roof shingles, broken tree limbs, bird's nests, etc.   Must be stable, but can be carried in a pocket, weighs very little and is very clear. Very good deal.

I haven't used it much but the few photos I have taken are excellent. I'm not a photography expert so I'll leave the technicalities to others.  Telephoto capability is increased noticeably but not a huge amount.  The high quality of this lens, as with the wide-angle, is obvious.  Comes with caps and a storage bag

Was pleased to receive the Kodak Schneider-Kreuznach Xenar 1.4x 55mm Telephoto Lens and at a huge discount compared to other merchants. I do freelance photography and purchased this lens to use with the KODAK P712. The Kodak P712 is a great camera and takes excellent pictures. By adding the Kodak Schneider-Kreuznach Xenar 1.4x 55mm Telephoto Lens to the P712, it makes already great pictures even better, and what clarity. I recommend this product to everyone!

The picture and dimensions are incorrect.  It is a soft case but is ribbed horizontally and mine came in blue.  The correct dimensions are 2.9"x4.2"x1.8" (WxHxD).

It also fits the Fujifilm v10 camera which I bought it for.  Amazon has a different case built specifically for the v10 but it costs more and might be nicer based on that picture.  I am keeping this one, it is a perfect fit

I bought this as a present for my wife.  I was looking for something that she could carry in her purse.  the automatic functions are easy and functional.  It is not an enthusiasts camera:  too hard to get into the menus.  The screen is easy to turn off(this sucks battery power).  and it even has an optical viewfinder(a rare finding lately)  the optical viewfinder helps to get steady pictures for those of us with the shakes.  The pictures are clear and the colors are excellent.  The drawback is the that sony batteries cost an arm and a leg.  The wire for downloading pix is multifunctional and very proprietary(read that as expensive if you lose it

I purchased a Nikon L5 from Costco 2 weeks ago but returned it on Saturday after I saw the LZ-7.  The LZ-7 is way better in all aspects than the Nikon L5, save for the adjustable zoom in movie mode.

PROS:  Takes great pictures; optical image stabilization; 6X zoom; and, great price.  It is also made in Japan, not China as the Nikon L5 is.

Cons:  Fixed zoom while in movie mode; no on-board camera speakers

Fall through Spring I always carry my R817 in coat pocket when I go out. This jacket fits my camera like a glove. Allows access to all controls and LCD display through clear, heavy duty plastic film, once flap is opened. Open flap allows lens to zoom while still protecting rest of camera.

Upgrading to the TZ3 from a 4yr old Canon 3.2 megapixel. Waited a few months to purchase when I heard the TZ1 was being updated. With the TZ3, Panasonic has fixed the main complaints about the TZ1 which were: No build in lens cover, noisy images at higher ISO speeds. IMO, the build in lens cover alone is wirth the price permium over the TZ1. 

As others have said, this camera has a great build quality, easy operation, and a high-quality look. I ordered the black model and was pleasantly surprised when I opened the box. It has the look of a retro 35mm cartridge camera, which is cool. The chrome (or polished stainless steel, cant tell), is first rate and looks great with the matte black case. The LCD is huge and bright. The camera's "Simple Mode" does a great job the the other modes are fully customizable. The zoom is fantastic, but you need a really steady hand at full zoom, even with Optical Stabilization turned on. I did take some surprisingly sharp shots zoomed way in from my car as I came across a herd of deer. Shot to shot speed is really great, unless you are using the flash. The red-eye reduction works better than any other digital camera I have used. Overall, I am extremely pleased. If you are looking for a great zoom camera in a small form factor, you should seriously consider the DMC-TZ3

I shot my second feature (Flying Tiger) on the DVX and took it to the Cannes Film Fest market and no one could tell it wasn't film.  This camera is fantastic if you shoot right.  I suggest this camera over all the other similarly-priced models.  We have done extensive testing with many cameras and this is my favorite.  The JVC is many thousands more and you get less grain with it in dark areas, true, but for the money, the DVX, if you shoot properly with it, will get you amazing results.  

For proof, you can check out footage shot in a ton of lighting conditions at my site.  

We had the best luck in natural light, with simple chimera diffusers.  If you're honest with yourself and don't plan on hitting the lottery anytime soon (getting a real distribution deal/full 35mm blowup) and you need a good looking film for fests or DVD, there is no way you should shoot on film, or another camera.  We shot a full feature on no money and had many distrib offers, all because of the look this camera gave us.  I'm planning on using it again for my next film.  !Viva la revolucion!  Put the DVX in 24p Advanced mode and rip the knob off

-Function is easy to use.
-Battery life is so so. 
-Battery charger design is not convenience. You have the put the battery into the batter charger. recommand to get a cradle charger, but extra cost. It should sell with cradle charger.

I think is a "must" for any beginner, for a low price you can have almost all the different size of EP. Try them for a few months and then when you will be completely sure what do you want and buy the EP that you need.

When I first opened up the "Super Quick Charger" I was a bit put off... it's small, it's cheap looking... compared to the old NiCd charger I used to have it was very unimpressive. Then I plugged it in. 

Say what you will about this barebones solution, it works amazingly well. It charges the batteries quickly and the batteries last a really long time in between charges. It does exactly what I was looking for. 

If I could improve anything it would be to implement some sort of cover on the battery slots. While it's not essential to the process by any means, it would look a lot better, and the batteries would be less prone to being jostled out of their positions in mid-charge by a curious cat.

I love this battery charger!  I used to use store bought AA batteries for my Olympus digital camera, but after keeping the batteries in the camera for only a week, the batteries were drained of power.  For some reason, this twin battery pack can stay charged for a few months if I am just storing my camera.  Highly recommended

I own the stylus 710 that I have had since september of last year, and love it to pieces.  Little did I know olympus was relaseing this little monster onto the market 2 months later.  It has all of the features and software of the 710 model, with digital image stabilization, but 
5x optical/5.6x digital/28x total zoom , an upgrade from 15x total zoom (3x optical and 5x digital).  The price is about the same, and actually an excellent deal here on amazon. The 2.5" color LCD monitor with histogram display and auto image rotation has been standard in the 710 and 810, and the 1000 series, and I have not problem with it, I think it is comparable to all models in this range (panasonic, fuji, kodac, hp).  I the bright sun, no LCD is going to be really great. I have captured many fun moments with this camera (2 weddings, 2 vacations) and love it. The diffence with the 740 model is the thickness is a bit bigger due to the bigger optical lense, but that is well worth the sacrifice, because having more optical zoom = better picture.  I know, I tested this side by side with my 710.  Pick this up, you will not be dissapointed. Also, look at the 750 and the 760 models, both of which have optical image and digital image stabilization, but alter the zooms a bit.  Compare, and see what meets your needs. 

Also, the Olympus Mastersoftware is very easy to use, And with panoramic feature, 3d, and Extra ART Features unlocked by Olympus Brand-Olympus Stamped Type H HD, this camera becomes even more of a pleasure to own. you can edit photos on the computer, or right in the palm of your hand. Both ways, this camera will make you feel like a pro in no time.

I took this case with me to my trip to New Zealand and it allowed me to take amazing pictures of rafting and cave tubing.  If I didn't have this case I would have missed out on amazing shots.  It's a great way to protect your camera from sand as well.  I loved it so much I actually bought one for my sister as well.  It is a great investment for anyone that doesn't want to worry about their camera getting ruined and also wants to take amazing underwater pictures and videos

Looks exactly as the posted picture except the badge reads "Panasonic", not "Lumix". Fits the camera perfectly. No extra room for memory cards, spare battery, charger, etc. It's easier to insert the camera with both zippers down. The belt loop won't fit most belts. No straps. However, the camera's strap is good enough. Good protection

I'm like most people with a digital camera. I take a bazillion pictures, develop 10% onto paper, and then banish the other 90% to computer storage archives. I mean, I'd love to display a lot more of those pictures from my computer, but who has the wall space or time to organize all of those prints? That's why I decided to get a digital picture frame. I had been looking for quite some time, but was always turned off by the small-ish LCD sizes or poor resolutions. Then I came across this Coby 10" widescreen unit, with the 800x480 pixel display! There were no reviews on Amazon (at the time), but spec-wise it had what I wanted; a larger display and higher resolution.

I took the chance and ordered one and am I glad I did! The display is huge, and the pictures look crisp. Colors are pretty accurate when compared to that of my calibrated LCD computer monitor. The interchangeable frames (it comes with a black one as well as the white one) make it easy to match with your d?or. The litte remote is easy to use, but easy to lose as well, so make sure you place it somewhere easy to find. The built-in MP3 player is a nice touch. The speakers aren't that great (it is a picture frame after all), but it's nice to have the frame play music while in slideshow mode. There is a variety of transition effects to choose from. I haven't tried playing videos on it, so I can't comment on that feature.

That being said, there are a few things that prevent me from giving this 5 stars.

1. The adjustable stand is made of cheap feeling plastic. I've seen other frames that have much nicer backs. Yes, I know it's the front you are looking at, but the stand should be sturdier, in my opinion.

2. The angle of the stand, while adjustable, is simply held in place by friction. It actually has one setting that it can click into, but then it is angled too much to view at a normal position.

3. There seems to be a software bug that causes the display to act weird in slideshow mode. Well, to be more precise, if you are in slideshow mode and you choose either the Fade, Mask, or Cross Comb transition effects, then the very top horizontal pixel line starts to show black sections. It looks like dead pixels, but once you exit the slideshow (or use other effects other than then ones I listed) everything is fine. I have recreated this problem, but I don't know if it's just my frame or all of these. No biggie. I now use no transition effects it is perfect.

4. This is not really a complaint about the product but more about Coby's specs. On their website they state the LCD is 800x480. Great! So I ordered the frame and then resized a whole bunch of pictures to that resolution. However, when I got the frame and started using it, I noticed that all of my pictures had black (blank) bars on both the left and right sides of the picture. It turns out that the resolution is actually 860x480 (which I found out after some trial-and-error). It would have been nice to know this ahead of time to save me from having to re-resize my pictures. Plus, sizing pictures to 860x480 is a really weird ratio... kinda like getting 4x7 prints.

I ordered this from Total Electronics (one of the Amazon vendors) and it arrived quickly. When I reported the "dead pixel" problem (which turned out to be a software bug, not a defect, so to speak), they responded to my email quickly and offered to take it back no questions asked. Now that's customer service!

Overall, I am very pleased with this product. In reality, it rates 4.5 stars. I'm the type of person that agonizes over something before finally buying it. With this purchase, that was totally unncessary!

I just got this camera recently along with the printer. Setting up was very simple. The only problem I came across was putting the ribbon in the printer. You have to use your finger to remove the slack from the ribbon but it's not that easy. When you put the ribbon in the printer it gets caught on something and could damage the ribbon. It takes time and tons of patients to get that ribbon in the printer. The pictures come out very nice and print even better. I washed a couple of pictures to test the quality and they came out flawless. This camera is a value and shouldn't be passed up. The screen on the camera is huge and the buttons take some time to get use too. If you have any further questions feel free to comment them and I'll reply as possible

Very easy to use, multiple languages, something nice and easy for even unexperienced users.  Recommend to anybody buy it, it's worth it.  And the price is right for the features and MP.  I would not hesitate to pay more for this camera.  Kodak has done wonderful job with this on

 I bought this sweet little thing because I am planning a day in NYC and don't want to bring along my regular camera, which is bulky. This camera is nice and small and would fit in any purse or coat pocket. It has 5 MP and a 3X optical zoom which is great for the price. The pictures I took outside turned out outstanding. Inside pics were a bit pixelated, but I may have had the settings wrong. The camera is easy to use right out of the box.

Perfect for a second camera to keep on you just in case

I have received this camera for serveral weeks. It's a good long zoom digital camera. I can use it for 18x optical zoom when I set its photo size less than 3M EZ. the photo isn't blur as I use image stabilized. The picture is sharp. Image quality is good. However I have to set the ISO at 100 or 200. When the ISO is 400 or above, I can see the noise, and the picture lose detail. But every camera has its own defect. Overall, I am satified with this camera, and I am enjoying using it to take pictures.

This battery for my Cannon camera is a great little "back up" battery.  My camera came with a Cannon battery and charging unit.  The replacement Cannon battery sells for over $40.00 so purchasing this CTA battery at less than $10.00 is a very good choice.

I bought this camera six months ago for my 12 year old daughter.  It was her (and ours) first digital camera.  I read so many reviews prior to selecting this model.  The reviews for this camera were so helpful.  This camera has been so easy to use and it takes excellent pictures.  Rechargeable batteries are definitely a must! This camera is the best camera for this price, no doubt about it.  We have taken still shots and videos.  It is so fun to have the option to take a video.  We have some great clips.  All I can say is we are so happy with the camera.  We would definitely choose it again

This camera is an exelent camara. It has plenty of effects, plenty of modes, plenty of scenery options. The image quality is 3.2 megapixel, but its quite good. The pictures you take without the flash do end up getting a bit blury, where as if you take it with the flash, it comes out exelent. And sometimes it takes a long time for the picture to get taken with out the flash, and sometimes it happens imediatly. But all these flaws are only with my version.

But if you are looking for a good camera with a great price, this is your best option

Because of it's non-intrusive red lighting, and especially because of its size and brightness control, this is the perfect little light to bring out in to the field for observing.  One caution; make sure you have the lanyard securely around your wrist, especially if you're shining the light down a tube to collimate.  One slip, and it'll be headed toward your primary

I purchase this lens for the Digital Rebel XT body I also purchased through Amazon.  So far the lens has performed as expected.  It is solid and well built.  Sticks slightly, when zooming through 200mm.  Images are crisp and focus is sharp.  Working at 300mm can be a challenge without using a mono or tripod.  Shooting a bird in flight at 300mm is a trick. 
Overall, good lens for  $200.  If you have more money, then a lens with Image Stabilization (IS) would be the way to go.

I received one of these for Christmas...so I've had it for 6 months now.  I've taken thousands of shots with it, on both a Canon Digital Rebel XT (350d) and a Canon EOS 20d.

The bottom line...I really like the lens.  Although you must learn to to optimize its use at 200MM.

Specifics...

1)  At 200MM (Max telephoto), you will see some blur if you don't use a high shutter speed and hold it steady.  This means that just placing your camera on the green "point and shoot" mode, or even "P" mode may not give you a fast enough shutter speed to keep from having blur unless you are in bright daylight.  So....here's my technique:  at 200MM you may want to bump up your ISO (film) speed to 400 or 800, then use Tv mode (Canon settings I'm talking about - manual shutter speed control) to get a fast shutter speed.  I also hold the end of the lens (the petal filter) with my left hand and lean against a solid object or have a good foot stance - or use a tripod.  All of this is not any sort of lens defect; rather, it is typical of using a long tele lens that does not have Image Stabilization (IS).  You can get IS from Canon, but be ready to lay down some $$$ and carry multiple lenses...more on that later.

2)  Noisy autofocus.  Yeah, true, it is louder than other lenses, but so what.  It is not any louder than the fake autowinder sound my Rebel XT makes.  I find its focus quick and accurate - except in low light.  Although, I will say my 20d does much better than my 350d did with this lens in low light.  But, honestly, I don't think the low light autofocus is any worse than the Canon 18-55 kit lens I initially ised.  IT hunted a lot too in low light, and often would not lock - necessitating manual focus.  Perhaps it is the camera, not the lens.  Regardless, manual focus on the Sigma works great in low light, or, to keep autofocus, you can use an external flash for IR focus assist and it locks right up.

Other than the Tamron, you WILL NOT find as versatile a lens as this one, especially at this price point.  Optical quality is great on my lens.  You can do better - but with two lenses.  My solution to have this kind of range if $$$ was no object would be the Canon EF-S 17-85MM f4-5.6 IS USM and the Canon EF 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6 DO IS USM...this would add image stabilization and 100MMs more range, but at much more cost, and you would have to carry two lenses.

I specifically bought this lens to have a compact, one lens solution.  If you read all the reviews you can find, the general consensus is that the Sigma is better than the Tamron 18-200.  Plus, the end barrel does not rotate, so you can use a circular polarizer.  Show me a lens that has better bang for the buck in a one lens solution, and I'll buy it.  Until then, I love my Sigma

This is a great product. I wish I had not waited so long to purchase it. You must be aware that it only works with L type batteries. I though that it would work with P or M types, which is what I have for 2 Sony camcorders. I had to then purchase an L battery (NP-F970). My old camcorder that uses P batteries is able to charge L batteries as well. Do your homework with the batteries

My Sony FX1 has great low light capability, 3 lux, but eventually you WILL need extra light. Using your software to lighten dark shots will likely reveal some degree of graininess, no matter which camera you use.

I'm so glad I bought it.  Used it for my birthday party. Though the overhead light was good, dark corners of the room require more light. If you consider yourself advanced, semi-pro, or a pro videographer, you MUST HAVE a light.

My only major beef is it runs at either 10 or 20 watts. No variable for 5, or 15.  It is worth getting a long life battery like the NP-970. Independent power source (battery) is a plus. But no outlet plug adaptor that I know of

I bought this camera to replace a Casio Exilim EX-S500 that was sadly stolen from me.  It's the same size, which I love, and as convenient, which is awesome.  It has a large bright screen to see the pictures you are taking or have taken.  It's one of my favorite things ever

As a novice astronomer I really enjoy the sharp, steady view with these binoculars. The view is fairly steady even with the I.S. off - depending how stable you are of course. My binoculars cost more than my telescope !! And my telescope is a decent one too. But I think they are worth it. You see so much more in the night sky than what the naked eye can see - by far. They are of course great during the day too. Their weight is not much of an issue for me, although each person is different depending on their viewing habits. I think a hard carry case would have been the best but it's not a big deal for my use. I recommend this pair of binoculars to anyone who is serious about great quality and performance

This is only the second pair of binoculars I've owned but I've used many pairs before from low end to relatively high end ones like Nikons and Leicas.  I can say without hesitation that the Canon 18X50s have met all my expectations for clarity, build quality, and ease of use. They are still quite heavy so, you won't be holding them too long in one position but, the stabilization feature provides a stable, gitter free image. In my opinion, this feature makes up for optics that may not be in the same league with the high end stuff: the Canon 18X50s have more usable magnification for the money for non-tripod, hand held applications. 

While this is not a scientific comparison, this is an example of the useability and magnification: I was at the beach looking at a parasailer in the distance - with the naked eye (20/20 for the record), I could see the chute pattern and a black speck below it; with my old Minolta 10X50s (jittering in my hands)I could make out shapes of heads and legs; with the Canon 18X50s, I could clearly see two people, a man and a child as well as the chute's cords - pretty impressive.  

My only two gripes that have also been mentioned before are: no lense caps and the eye cups are stiff, fit poorly (to my face any way) and are uncomfortable. I find it better to fold the cups back for "eye glass" use even though I don't wear glasses.  Other than that, I am very pleased with this purchase and would also highly recommend purchasing from Adorama Camera - they are quick, accommodating and responsive.

I purchased an off brand to use with my FXF-10 when this case was on back order.  It was terrrible, so I ordered this case and am thoroughly pleased.  The camera fits perfectly into the case and, although it is described as a "soft case," it is durable and will protect your camera with style without adding additional bulk

This lens is fairly inexpensive and the reason for that is while it definitely lets you get really close and the image is definitely larger than without it, the fact is the FZ7 and the FZ30 macro settings are already so good that the image is perhaps 15% or so bigger than without it.  If I can I'll post a couple flower images to permit comparison with and without the lens. The camera I have is a FZ7.  Because I want as large an image as possible of my focus I am very happy

I have sticked with Sony since I got my first digital camera 4 years ago and Sony camera has been the moneys worth! This one DSC-T10 is the one for the parent who is carrying to much already and needs to pack down for a change. It fits in my purse and still have space for more, the only thing to remember to buy a slim fitting case for the camera and an extra battery(for those kind of battery are not sold everywhere) you need that one when you don't thing you need an extra battery, you always run out at the wrong time.
I recommend this one

This case is great for the quick day outings.  It is rugged and keeps the camera safe.  My wife can throw it in her purse and I don't have to worry about it getting banged up and she doesn't have to worry about it being too bulky.  Everyone should have two batteries with any of the Canon cameras since their battery meter only shows up minutes before it goes dead.

When the ETX-90PE works, it works very well and makes astronmomy an easy hobby to get into.  Let me elaborate.

First, the best telescope is the one you use most often.  All too frequently people buy big telescopes that are heavy to carry, and that need frequent adjustment.  The little ETX weighs less than 20 lbs all set up (including tripod), and never needs adjustment.  It encourages frequent use.

Second, one of the most challenging aspects of astronomy, especially for the newcomer, is finding objects to look at.  If you are not familiar with the night sky and where things are located, it can get very frustrating spending up to 30 minutes just to find one object to look at!  The ETX's built in computer makes finding objects easy - just select what you want to see from a menu, and the scope will automatically point to it.

The optical quality of the ETX is excellent.  The manufacturer, Meade, does a very good job of turning out optical systems that rank with the best.  Some of the most rewarding objects - the Moon, Jupiter, Saturn, and the Orion Nebula look wonderful through this telescope.

One final positive to mention is the ease of setup.  The PE models are the easiest of all telescope to get up and running.  Just turn on the power, press one key on the hand held computer controller, and in a few moments the telescope will start aligning itself so that it will automtically find objects for you.  You don't need to worry about where north is, or what the current date, time, and location are.

Now some cautions.  First, the ETX-90 is a small telescope, and will not show as much as a larger one.  That is the trade-off with getting a portable instrument.  There are larger ETX models that are almost as portable, so these might be a consideration.  Also, understand that there will be a learning curve when using the built in computer.  It's not hard, but you need to have some patience while you learn the procedure.  Finally, be prepared for some quality control issues.  As good as the optics are, some ETX's have some mechanical problems that require a return to the factory for warranty repair.  My own ETX-90PE had to go back to the factory twice.  But once all the problems were fixed, it was well worth it!  On this note, you can purchase an extended warranty from the manufacturer at a reasonable price, and I would recommend doing so

Due to a canoe accident on vacation, mine went completely underwater for at least 5-10 seconds. But - only a trickle of water got inside. Once that dried out, much to my surprise, both the AF and VR functions worked fine. All that's left is two small water spots on the inside of the objective lens (Okavango Delta water is clean!).

Don't try this at home. Next time I'm even near a canoe, I'll have everything in dry bags.

I needed a tele lens to complement my D50 purchase.

A didn't want to spend too much money on it but I needed one that a least matched my Lumix FZ10 in sharpness.

This certainly did and the VR really works, I am able  to take sharp pictures up to  1/40.

I would like to add to the reviews already posted, especially for anyone considering this lens as an alternative to the 80-400 VR.  This is one of the only times I can remember when I have had the money to buy a Nikon lens, but have not been able to bring myself to do it.  The 80-400 is 6 years old, uses ancient mechanical (slow) focus, and has yet to be updated with VRII technology.  All that, and it still costs more than the pro-quality Canon 100-400 IS, which has Canon's AF-S equivalent too!  That said, I like long yet portable lenses, and after giving myself fits decided to "settle" for the 70-300 because it has VRII and AF-S.  If you are in the same boat then buy this lens, it is a gem for its intended purpose.  I get sharp results wide open at 300, and the light weight more than offsets the slower apertures.  I would have LOVED this lens if it was an f/3.5, but even at 4.5-5.6 I have really been surprised at the results.  Save the $1000+ until Nikon updates the 80-400 dinosaur

I see a lot of people have had trouble tracking baseballs with this thing.  I've owned one for 3 years and it works pretty well.  I will give some tips on it:

!!!If you throw at a respectable speed, and don't follow the correct procedure it will not work - there will be no reading!!

1) Don't stand behind a metal fence.  The Chain links with the plastic coating over them will work, but for whatever reason exposed metal interferes with the signal.

2) The focus beam of the radar gun is very narrow.  The whole idea is to keep the beam on the ball as long as possible.  Just having the ball pass through the radar beam is not enough.  You need to keep the beam on the ball for practically the whole pitch.

3) Use rechargable batteries... and this isn't to save money.  Some of the better Energizer rechargable are high amperage, 1350 mA and up.  The gun tends to respond better to this, as its pretty power hungry.  You will get more consistant readings with better batteries.  Non-rechargable batteries cannot provide the same level of current (usually 850 mA or less), which seem to effect the gun.

So, how would you properly use the gun?

One way is to stand behind the mound as the pitcher throws.  Forget about using it during a game, behind the backstop.  It wont work.

Try line up the pitchers release point and the plate, then situate your gun so that it fires on this imaginary line (connecting pitchers hand and the target.  

You may have to slightly change the angle of the gun to track the pitch, which can be slightly tricky.  Follow the ball with the gun as long as you can.

For a sure fire way to clock a throw, get a cheap net and stand behind it.  You will register it every time.  You will also have the most accurate reading

This is a pretty accurate radar gun for baseball, as far as I can tell. If you follow the directions, and are as close to the action as possible, and at a "straight on" angle, it looks like its correct in the + - 1 mph statement. However, this is a cool gadget, but if you are serious about "speed" and would like more versatility, then your going to have to go with the official MLB JUGS gun...but at a much higher price.

good luck

Bought this tripod to use with my spotting scope for target shooting. Easy attachment to my scope and multiple adjustment heights, with the crank, make it easy to zero in on the target and allow anyone to see thru the scope, no matter how tall they are. Compact and lite to carry, makes it easy to transport to and from the range

I bought this camera to replace a high MP Sony pocket camera, and I am thrilled with it.  The picture quality is absolutely gorgeous in any lighting.  The red eye reduction really works, and gets rid of the red-eye before it ever gets to the memory card.  It has a compact flash card memory system, which is great because big compact flash cards are much more afforadable than the other types of cards.  This camera is better than my brother's Canon SLR in terms of picture quality, but not nearly as bulky and cumbersome.  The battery life is fantastic.  One other nice feature is the screen at the top of the camera which lets you see how many pictures you have, and the batter life, mode, etc without opening the screen.  The only drawbacks to this camera are (1) not the biggest zoom lens, but plenty enough for the typical photographer, (2) the screen could be bigger, but still acceptable, and (3) when you have the screen open, you can't use the viewfinder, which is a little annoying, but not a big deal.  I have owned 4 other high-end digital cameras and this is by far the best one I have ever used.

This film seems a lot better than Kodak Max 400 even though it is basically the same thing (except for the fact that it's black and white).  I wouldn't recommend this for proffesionals, but it's great for the average person

For the price, you get a lot out of this camera. 6X zoom Stabilized,  the images comes out great at full zoom (2 stabilization mode).  The aid of a histogram will tell you the right exposure to set for your picture.  The multiple program modes, just about lets you take a great picture under different situation! Controls are easy to use and get to. In all definitely a great buy for the price.  The down side is that movie mode has no sound but if that is a factor then get the DMC-LZ5 or a camcorder.

Easy to learn, takes very good photos in well-lighted areas but you DO need to use the flash for dimmer environments - its low-light capabilities aren't that great. Very fast readiness time from the moment you switch on the camera - a bit slow to recharge from a flash, though, and there's a bit of a lag when you press the shutter button to when the photo is actually taken (not so great for fast action shots, even though it touts a "sports" mode). It's a good beginner's camera, a good pocket-style camera, but certainly not to be mistaken for a high-end unit.

set the diffusion to 'stun' when you don't want your flash to 'kill' with harsh, sharp, shadowy edges. yes, you need this if you have an sb-600. why? nikon doesn't make a diffuser for that model. basically, it fits snugly on the tip of the flash, slides off and on easy, will also protect your flashbulb from acidental nicks, like that macro shot of the benihana chefs. here's what it does: diffuses your flash without having to go all into your menu settings and make adjustments. simple, Sherlock. the omni-bounce (what an imaginative name for a piece of shaped plastic) performs as expected, no real cons, except shipping adds almost 50% to the price, so check your local camera shop to see if they have it in stock before ordering

This diffuser is the same quality as the one that comes with the Nikon SB 800 flash.  It is much better than other aftermarket diffusers that require velcro.  This is made to fit the SB 600 perfectly.  It snaps on and off easily.  Angled at 75 degrees it provides excellent fill. I use it on the SB 600 set up as a slave with the SB 800 for fill and back lighting.  It should have been included by Nikon as original equipment but is inexpensive and cost effective.  Much better than the built in plastic flat diffuser

This seemingly simple piece of molded plastic was recommended to me by a professional photographer.  Basically it's the shape of an open box that slides firmly onto the flash.  It is small and sturdy enough to stash in your camera bag without worrying about damage.  When used the light disperses more evenly and is less harsh on the subject being photographed.

The white box is for general use.  Also available are the green Omni-bounce for florescent lighting and the gold Omni-bounce for a warming effect.

PROS:
Inexpensive solution for better flash photography.
A quality product that works.

CONS:
Non

We love this camcorder!  We bought it because our other bulky, digital video that uses tapes, which we would have to copy onto VHS/DVD, stopped working.  We didn't want to spend a lot of money.  We loved the idea that it was easier to carry in my purse and you could download it straight to the computer or burn it (which is very simple to do, and you do not have to download any software.)  I have to admit I was a little reluctant that the quality of the picture would be less than great, and only 60 minutes concerned me, but the pictures is great and I haven't ran out of time yet.  We have used this indoors, outdoors and have no problems.  We have recorded our son's basketball games and it worked great.  We read where the batteries didn't last very long, but we have been using rechargeable batteries and have been impressed with lifetime they have.  This is a must for those who have children or grandchildren

I really enjoy my Photosmart R725.  It's small, easy portable, takes wonderful photos, and is very versatile in terms of settings.  I just have one thing I don't like about it, and that's the fact that there is no viewfinder.  There is an LCD screen on the back which acts as a viewfinder, but it's hard to see in bright sunlight, and I'm afraid that it will eventually become scratched beyond use.  For now, it's great but I'm not sure how it will hold up for the long run.  At the same time, it's not spendy, so it might be worth it

Outstanding camera in every respect. I've owned several digital cameras in recent years (Sony &amp; Nikon). The N2's giant 3" LCD, the touch screen features, lens optics, and overall ease of use top any of my previous cameras. I use it for both land and underwater photography and it performs flawlessly. Good job Sony

I bought this flash to use on a light pole with a flash trigger when we shoot weddings.  Rather than use one of my Canon 580's, I thought this was a better use of my $$-since I use this additional light in manual mode anyway. It does the job for under $10

For the price it is a very good value especially with the capability of bouncing the flash in several directions.  Using the internal flash either left dark or washed out images at times.  This flash solves the problem.  I've dealt with ADORAMA several times and it was a pleasant experience.  Items were sent quickly

This flash is the perfect back-up for a studio, or Main/flash fill for an amateur studio.  I use several w/slaves and lines and the images rival set-ups that cost thousands of Dollars.  I like that they are light and easy to pack and transport.  They are reasonably priced.  They have been around for a long time and do not have bells and whistles.  The SUNPAK has auto/f-stop and manual.  If you are a real photographer, you will know how to use them.  The down side is that if your SUNPAK is plugged into a wall, it takes far too long to recharge (sometimes 3-5 seconds).  Rechargeable batteries seem to work the best with 1-3 second recharge times between flashes.

I enjoy the convenience of a point and shoot digital camera.  My Minolta Dimage X (about 15% small in size than this camera) had reached the end of its useful life, having been around for about 5 years.  The Minolta had a 3/4" screen on the back.  (this one has a 2.5" screen- great colors)

The best feature I liked about my old camera was the fact that there was not a telescoping zoom lens.  I don't like the fact that a part that needs to move so often has the possibility to get gummed up and dirty.  Therefore, I was excited that this camera had an internal zoom.

Tonight I was at a Bulls game, in the 300 section (nose bleed), and was able to zoom in and get a individual photo of Kirk Hinrich.  The 3x optical zoom is incredible, but more so incredible is the digital zoom.  I was also able to zoom into the jumbotron, and it looked as crisp as if I was taking the photo directly. 

Action shots are GREAT. Low light shots are GREAT!  

It is exactly what I was looking for

I bought this camera around the beginning of July and have used it several times already.  I've upgrade from a Nikon Coolpix 3200 to this one due to smaller, sleaker size and more megapixels.  This camera takes excellent pictures, in broad daylight as well as in the dark.  Red eye reduction is wonderful, however the flash does go off about 4 or 5 times.  It's not broken... it's supposed to do that for everybody who thinks their camera has a glitch.  Overall, I think this was definitely a good buy and am looking forward to taking the camera on vacation!

It was time to upgrade my 2.0 MP Canon PowerShot S200 which is more than three years old (ancient in a digital world) to a camera which takes higher quality pictures. The newer Canon cameras had a larger screen, but it was basically the same camera. After a month, I am still pleased that I purchased the Nikon CoolPix S6:

+ push button to switch between camera versus play modes (versus a toggle slide which is hard on the nails)
+ easy-to-navigate mode and menu options with flywheel like an iPod
+ no telescopic lens = no annoying zoom sound during focus, on/off, less wear-and-tear on the most vulnerable component

Before I get K10D, I experienced with Olympus E-500, CANON XTI, Nikon D80.
I used Olympus E-500 to take lots vivid color pictures that I love very much, but no water resistance and no second Display window, also only 3 focus point makes it not so enjoyable. Same thing happen to Canon XTi, no water resistance and no second Display window make it little hard to use when you need to change settings. The Nikon D80 is a great camera but also have no water resistance and shake reducer build in on camera, the color tone of D80 isn't the kind that I would love. Finally I bought Pentax K10D, the feeling of the body,the water resistance, shake reducer,auto dust remove,vivid color tone,etc...makes me feel the K10D is the way to go. Only complaint would be the Limited Edition Lens are hard to get. Get it while you can

I purchased the Pentax K10D digital SLR about four weeks ago, and am very happy with this camera and the two lenses--18-55mm and 50-200mm. With the shake reduction and anti-dust features, You can`t go wrong. If you went with Canon or Nikon, you would pay through the nose for their lenses. The construction is very solid with seals that help prevent dust and water entering the camera.The features of the K10D make it a joy to use. I would highly recommend this camera to anyone moving up to a digital SLR. I am age 81, so it`s never too late to move up the ladder. W.C.RHYN

The enclosure has a solid feel to it.  I dove with it three times with no problem at all. It would be nice if the weight does not cost extra.  
The only compliant I have is that the enclosure is a tight fit, so it is very difficult to fit a desiccant into the enclosure

I love this camcorder. It is very easy to use, the piture quality is great. You can record wide screen or full screen. Light weight, fits in the palm of your hand which is more stable and less shaky when taping. The controls are within easy reach while taping. It is so easy to use that both of my kids have even been using it and they are only 9 and 6. It is also a great price. Can't wait for all our summer vacations to start taping. 

I bought this camcorder two weeks ago from best buy. I just wrote my review and then read the others and I had to add this in, there were comments being made that you can hear the tape while recording and then in the play back. I slightly hear the noise when I am taping, but I cannot hear it when I am playing it on my dvd player. To hear the noise while taping you have to have it right next to your ear. But not noticable on the playback on computer or through the dvd player

  I am writing to offset some negative opinions on this unit. I bought the Canon because it has facilities for an external mike. I am a new camcorder user and so have no practical experience to bias my opinion one way or another. First on the matter of tape drive noise: yes I can hear it if I put the unit up to my ear. But no noticeable noise comes up on actual movie clips when played back through my computer. Second, they claim you can interconnect and capture clips to your computer. What they don't tell you is that you need a Firewire card and cable (about $70.00 total at Best Buy). You cannot simply hook up through the available computer USB port. Fortunately, Microsoft provides the necessary drivers in the XP OS and minimal capture software called "Moviemaker". 

 I am not too pleased with the tape system but considering the price of the unit, I think it is a bargain. Finally, I have become aware through short experience with the unit that the ergonometric design for the right hand was very well thought out. Your thumb easily controls on/off and tape transport functions. It is really easy to use, at least for right handed users. All considered, I am satisfied with the product. Of course, if it dies next week, I will have a different opinion

I am just an average guy when it comes to using a camera. Probably below average. I started trying to use 100% Sony electronic products because my computer was a Sony and Sony-Sony linkages make for easy use. Given that, here is what I think of the product:

1. It is amazing how much camera you can get for the money. Compared to just 6 months ago, or a year ago, this is a lot of camera for the money. It is very small, fits easily in your pocket, but takes great pictures. Also, it is very easy to use and recharge. 

2. A visit to the Sony website, suggests that Sony has new cameras coming out constantly -- new cameras that are very similar.  This makes it hard to compare cameras, even within the Sony brand, and makes you feel as if your camera is obsolete the minute you buy it.

3. A problem with this camera, given it is so small -- do not shake. Your pictures will be blurry. I am a typical guy, with very little fine motor control. My hands have trouble holding small objects. Holding this camera in one hand and taking a picture -- well the results are not pleasant.

4. I tend to be disappointed by the telephoto capabilities of these small cameras. I guess if you really want to zoom in, then you have to go to a big camera. But it still seems like the small cameras could offer more.

5. Having said all of that, in the end, this camera is small and easy to carry, light weight, durable, and it is also easy to use. When you look at it, it looks well made. I ended up giving the camera to my in-laws, because they lost theirs. My in-laws tend to be technologically challenged. I said to them, just leave the dial set to the little green camera, and snap away. I have to say - they love this camera. 

Overall. For the money, a great purchase, technology is amazing. Just grab it with two hands or develop a steadier aim than I have.

This lens hood designed specificaly for the Coolpix 5700 is a must-have accessory.  It does more than just protecting the lens, which it certainly does, esp. for those busy moments when you might bump the front of the camera on something solid.  (Don't forget Murphy's Law.)

But the lens hood can also improve your picture quality.  As with SLR lenses, the hood prevents light from entering the camera lens from the sides and enhances the sharpness and contrast of the picture.  This is especially true outdoors when the light is diffused (scattered).  Just use this all the time (see exception below) and your pictures out of the 5700 will be at their best (all other factors being equal, of course).

The only times you should *NOT* use the hood is when you use the built-in flash on the 5700, esp. indoors when the flash is used as the main lighting source.  The hood will block the flash and cast an ugly shadow on your nearby subject.  Even outdoors when you use the built-in flash for fill-in light, you should remove the hood first to avoid uneven exposure.

Get the hood today to improve your pictures and protect your camera

We bought this camera because our other digital camera (SONY DSC-H1) was too large to carry around a lot of the time. We took it skiing with us (Whistler, BC) and it took some outstanding pictures, both of persons and of landscape/scenery. It is small enough that you can pretty much carry it anywhere, anytime. Others may disagree, but the touchscreen menu controls are easy to use and fairly intuitive. Fingerprints do get on the screen but you hardly notice them and they are easily removed (or better yet, use the little wand they give you with the camera instead of your fingers, that doesn't leave any marks on the screen). To summarize: this is an excellent camera, very small size but with a large 3" LED display, takes EXCELLENT pictures, and the touchscreen menu is easy to use and intuitive. Most people will be very happy with this camera if they buy it. The only negative thing is that this camera does not have a view finder, but unless you have very bright sun at your back this isn't too much of a problem.

This is a camera that is very very easy to use. I was amazed by the colour quality even at a very low light. I took a movie at my nephew's theater play and I am the contrasts and crispness of the picture are just perfect. The zoom is also very clear and crisp. Putting it onto my iMovie was also a piece of cake. 
The only down point is that the still image mode is worthless, but if you need that you should buy the next level up which has a memory card slot.
I highly recommend this camer

I have had several digital cameras and this tops them all!!!!  Everything they say about it, is true.  I love not even having to think about batteries, I didn't believe what people said about the battery life, and I was just happy I didn't need to think about batteries, but I just got married and my 13 year old daughter took more than 100 pictures with this camera and her pictures are almost as good as the photographer I hired and yes the camera battery lasted all day and thru the next 4 days on our honeymoon with another 200 pictures taken, no low battery light!!!!!  I even going to buy my parents one.  Also, one more note I love how fast you can take pictures, no wait 4 seconds between shots.  I had a Kodak digital before only 1 1/2 years old and hated it, I hated the download procedure, it didn't put your pictures onto your hard drive, but in it's own little cubbyhole and trying to attach them to your email was absolutely a nightmare, you'd have to identify the picture copy it to your desktop, remember what you called it and then attach it your email.  This is the main reason why I purchased this camera.  I will never own anything else, especially a Kodak.

For years now I have been buying "bargain" cameras with the foolish notion that I did not need a nice one. Finally, I got sick of it and bought the Exilim EX-Z600. This camera is awesome. The screen is huge, the picture quality is great, it is easy to use and is sooo small. Overall, a great buy.

The one downside is that I can only connect it to my computer using the dock. Luckily, I have an SD card reader, so I normally just use that to download my pictures

I bough this waterproof case for a trip to St. Thomas over Christmas.
The photographs that we took came out perfect.  The flash diffuser worked well, by eliminating the air bubbles that normally are captured with underwater cameras.  Make sure that you set up your camera to the underwater mode so that it automaticlaly adjusts your color balance.  
The only problem that I had was since it is so compact, I often accidently would move the switch to movie mode.  This ruined a few photographs, but also made a great movie of a sea turtle coming up for air. 
I know that it was expensive, but much cheaper than buying a new camera or buying multiple disposable underwater cameras and having X-ray machines fog up the pictures

I bought this underwater housing in anticipation of a trip to the Galapagos.  It worked perfectly, and I obtained some really incredible shots, both still and video.  The combination of the Canon SD550 and this housing were amazing.  I did make sure to lubricate the primary o-ring each time I opened the housing.  But the need to do so was reduced by using a larger, 1GB memory card - both card and battery would last a little over two dives, before I need to change one or the other

I'm a long time Canon user and love the cameras but the lack of image stabilization on this one has me looking for an upgrade.  I can take decent pictures but if anyone else uses this camera, the pictures are fuzzy.  Take a look at one of the newer Canons with image stabilization and I think you'll be happier.

I dropped the camera from 2 feet and the metal outer rim of the lens slightly became bent and won't close. After some time spent tring to bend the metal back in place, I finally was able to close the lens. 

Besides that, it is an awesome camera. I am able to pick out a color (ex. red) and take a picture with that color standing out and everything else black and white. No photoshop needed

Kodak V705 Black: Small, can carry in pocket. Wide Angle Lens,great for group photos. Fast start up time. Video mode is easy, built in mic picks up all the sounds.Camera can stitch 3 photos together-great for vistas. I am happy with this camera. Bought another  V705 in silver for my friend and she loves it.Kodak makes easy to take photos.
Weak flash- try  not to be more than 6-8 feet away-or use photoshop on photos

I bought a spare battery for my D70s and charged it up one time. Since then, I have been waiting to use my spare but the original (charged hundreds of pictures ago) has been going strong for, literally, months.

Follow the directions. Don't use it until your fully charge and don't recharge until it's run down. This will help maintain battery life.

Good product from a great company

This is a great buy if you are just wanting to have some fun, with no real investment.  Although it does go beyond 17 feet, and that is not as far as you may think.  But, I used it while snorkeling and the pictures turned out great, and i am sure a few were more than 17 feet.

Like others I have compared it in a SCUBA diving trip to the Kodak Max Sport and this one had a few advantages:
1. Film winded at greater depth.
2. The pictures came out clearer - not grainy and with better colors.

Don't expect too much of it at depths below 8 meters since light won't be enough (I used it on a bright summer day in the red sea). Even at shallower depths colors turn blue/green without use of flash.

I have taken it down to depth of 35 meters and the camera was fine, but wouldn't take pictures at depths below 20 meters.

The pictures I took at shallow depth came out excellent

Pros: Compact, lightweight, portability, easy to use, big screen, good reproduction

Cons: Microphone sensitive to wind, getting used to not having a viewfinder, bad low light performance.

Summary: I picked this camera as an upgrade for my old Canon ZR10. The first reason I chose it was the small size and portability. With a good light conditions, this little beast do its best shots, but in low light conditions this camera disapointed me (specially compared with mi old ZR10). Please don't buy it if you have plans to use it for stills shots because it has a low resolution. 

The included handycam station have all the ports (Firewire, USB, power, video) you need to conect it. 

The big touch screen is a must, because the screen is the only way to access the camera controls (besides some of them in the edge of the screen). 

You can have a camera with more characteristics and better image quality for the same price, but if your concern is the size and portability this will be your best choice in the world of the mini DV format

I purchased this camera to use with my previous church's media ministry, based on my trial use of the VX2000.  That was three years ago.  This camera is STILL running as well as it did when I bought it. I use it upwards of 3 times a week to create content for web and DVD production, plus, I get great digital audio recordings when I plug directly into my current church's sound system.  The ability to tweak audio and video input on the fly is incredible.  Now that I am creating a multimedia team for our church, I've convinced the church to buy one for themselves

This camera is easy to use and makes a good quality recording. Since it is an upper end product, it does have a longer learning curve than more simple models but the effort is worth it for the added features. There are, however, a few quirks which could have been fixed to make this a much more usable piece of equipment.

The provided microphone jack is an 1/8" stereo. In my camera, at least, it is not mounted very securely. When I have an external mike connected, I had to be very careful to make sure that nothing touched it, otherwise, the sound would drop off. A friend with some tools and expertise fixed this problem but it should never have happened.

The master switch moves from off to VCR mode (up one), record to tape mode (down one) or record to stick mode (down two). It is intuitive but very easy to overshoot the mark. This can be frustrating and I cannot help but believe there is a better design that could be used.

The "VCR" controls are located on the top surface of the camera. They are intuitive and employ commonly used symbols. They are also backlit and impossible to discern in sunshine. You can see the symbols but there is no way to tell which, if any, of the functions are selected. It is still usable but it is a pain in the backside.

There are a multitude of things that could be done to make the interface on this camera easier to use but it is usable as it is now.

Reading the reviews of this camera reminds me that cameras are tools.  An imperfect tool in the hands of a master is much better than a perfect tool in the hands of a amatuer.  I am not a master, but I do appreciate this camera for what it can do and what its limitations are.  When you use ISO settings higher than 200 you will see increased noise.  I think it is a great little camera and I have used it a lot on my latest photo project.  Keep in mind one of the assets of this camera is its small physical size.  This also means small optical lens = less light gathering ability.  There is no way to compensate for this in the camera - so know this is a limitation and deal with it.

This camera is the best point and shoot cameras for the money. Just think of what you are getting. Not just a 7.2MP camera, but a LICA lens and technology. Not a bad deal. The images are not bad when printed. On a scale of 0-10, 10 beining the best, I give this camera an 8.

The Nikon S3 has proven to be a good buy.  It is affordable yet takes a quality photo.  In addition this camera is easy to use and fits conveniently in a pocket.  This camera has the ranging ability to take both a simple aim and shoot photo, and at the same time complex skill shots that is complemented by computer editing and redeye reduction.  My only complaint is as a result of the user.  If the camera does not have time to focus, then the picture quality suffers immensely. This camera has only been in use for about two months but has not let me down yet!

This is a very good camera for the price range. I have always had good luck with Sony products, unlike some of the reviewers here. The resolution of the viewer window and the image quality itself is more than what I would expect from a camera in this price range.... it's pretty decent. For what most people use DV cams for, this is camera doesn't suck at all.
I like how tiny it is. It doesn't go much past the palm of my hand when I'm holding it. Also it was very easy to figure out just by exploring the menu on the touch pad. Color graphics &amp; icons on the menus add a nice touch. A beginner could start filming very soon after opening the box, I think. The camera feels sturdy in my hand, I mean I don't feel like the viewer window is going to break off when it's open or that I could easily break the buttons with normal use. 

As others have mentioned, you have to buy a 4 to 6 firewire if you have a mac because the iLink cable that comes with it is a S-video input for TVs. Also the battery that comes with it is the 30 minute battery but I would have bought an extra one anyway because you never want to wait around while your only battery is charging. The software CD is a do-it-yourself install, at least for Mac. It might not be for PC. I'm used to being guided through the installation process... (since at least the early 90's!) but I had to drag the folder to my hard drive my darn self.  A minor thing but I would have expected more from a major company like Sony.
But the reason I give it a 4 star rating instead of 5 is because the firewire goes into the base, not the camera so you cannot have the camera on a tripod while it's connected to your machine. I realize this will not be a big problem for very many people but since I do stop-motion animation and use frame grabbing software, I need to have it connected to firewire and on a tripod in while I'm working. I almost returned the camera when I discovered this but instead I hot glued velcro to the bottom of the base and to my tripod adaptor so I could have the firewire plugged in and attached to the tripod....kinda ghetto. I figure it was worth it though since I got such a good camera for the price (I paid $299 on sale for it.)
If you're looking for a decent but cheap camera I would recommend either this one or the hc42 if you want to shoot in widescreen.

This is my first digital picture frame, so I do not have anything to compare it against.  I am generally very happy with this product - it is very easy to use, and I am happy with the resolution and the picture quality. 

The only downside to this frame is that the instruction manual is not helpful at all, and as one other reviewer noted, I had to learn how to do things by trial and error.  I also do not like that when you make changes to the layout - rotating or deleting images, it is not "saved" to the memory card and so you need to make the changes each time.  

However, I like this product enough to buy more of these for the grandparents this next Christmas

My husband is away (military) and I was looking for the perfect, small but clear, pictures for him.  I didn't care about the frame, only the small white digital system.  I was hesitant, as my MIL has a digital keychain and the picture quality is horrible.  I was pleasantly surprised at the picture quality and the ease of both looking at pictures already on an SD card and transferring pictures from the computer.  I love that I can use either batteries or the included plug.  Everything was soooo easy that I did not even need to read the instructions to begin.  I also purchased the small case to put this in for travel as the album is just an added extra for later.  This is the best investment for anyone looking for something very small and portable.  Perfect to send a military loved one lots of pictures to keep them involved no matter how far away they are!  Then, when he comes home, it's great for a portable album to carry anywhere

Good product, like the price.  This is much less expensive than the current pinseeker 1500 models, I bought it on ebay used for $150 so you may be able to find it for less (look under hunting AND golf rangefinders for this model).  This does not have the pinseeker feature of the newer models but normal mode and scan mode work perfectly for ranging flags that have no reflectors (although you may need to try more than one time and have relatively stable hands).  I was able to range a flag at 270 yards, and was able to range the top of a telephone pole at 375 yards (but it was windy so the flag was straight out and a little cloudy).  I would estimate that this will work for ranging flags on a calm sunny day (these don't work as well on a sunny day because the laser used is a visible light laser and gets a little interference from sunlight) at 215-230 yards for a flag (which is what I need it for).  Less expensive alternative than the pinseeker, and I really like the performance, very impressed.

I bought this camera for my 80 year old mother because I knew that if she was going to try digital photography, it had to be EASY ! The printer dock is simple for her to use to transfer snapshots of her cat to her computer and email them to her friends.   I have used the older CX-7300,( very similar camera) for backpacking for years and it has never failed under harsh conditions. The lack of optical zoom is a plus for me; less to break. The C530 is more compact, has better resolution, and still has the option of using AA batteries when the rechargables die. If you want simple digital snapshots, you will love this little camera

For an all-purpose color film, I nearly always shoot Fuji's 200 speed.  It has the cooler tones that I prefer in my images and a good saturation level.  The only drawback that I've seen while looking at various film prices here is that they are way over-priced!  The only place that I've seen where you pay more for film is in the supermarkets.  Any regular camera store or photo finisher will have this stuff for a lot less, and you won't have to wait for it to ship

I use this film just normally for everyday stuff.  It isn't grainy when you enlarge the photos, and the colors are just outstanding.  I use the 800 for the really important stuff though because I think the colors are more vibrant.  But, for just vacations, stuff around the house, the 400 will do a great job.  Anything less it basically a waste of money.  I shoot at least a roll a week just of everyday life and this is the one that I choose all the time.  I have a basket full

This is a pretty good camera, loaded with lots of features.  The pros include the 10x optical zoom, use of SD card, and battery consumption.  Also, with this camera you have the ability to buy add-ons such as zoom lenses and such - makes it nice for those that are just past beginner experience.

There are a couple of cons that I've found, the most important being the picture quality.  Although it does have the capability to take great photos, you have to make sure and wait several seconds between shots to ensure that they'll come out looking great (in my opinion, anyway).  The size is okay, although it is kinda bulky for being so small.  I prefer something that size to also be slim - it's not so easy to carry around because of this.

Overall, this camera is very easy to use

Have had the camera a short time and have grown to love its features and capabilities. Do purchase the 50 mm-200mm telephoto zoom lens; for the price it is a nice lens.  I tried the image stabilizer by shooting a picture of the air conditioner on my neighbor's roof using 200 mm telephoto.  When you enlarge the image you can read the label for the brand name!  Without the image stabilizer, it is a blur.  I did the same for a book about 100 ft away and using 200 mm setting. Without image stabilizer the title is blurred; with the image stabilizer it is sharp. A very nice feature is you can take an image and then enlarge a portion of it and save, or use filters to make them BW, soft, more bright, or with different color tones.  

People report that under tungsten light the auto setting gives a yellow tone without flash.  This is true.  However, you can use the P mode, which is like an auto mode, reset white balance easily to tungsten light and the picture comes out nice!.  Great low light capabilities with image stabilizer.

If you are into action photography, this may not be the camera for you.  It has limited ability to store a sequence of photos without a delay.  Other camers react faster and have larger capacity.  

Do reset default from bright to natural tone.  You can do this in some modes, but not all.  Read the manual, it really will empower you with many nice capabilities.  Newer lenses are light and small and interface with image stabilization system automatically

Nice portable background support kit.  Stability might be an issue but if portability is your first concern then you can overcome the stability issues with weights or caution.  Easy and quick to put up.  I put it up by myself with very little effort.  All rolls up in a nice compact bag for transporting

I'd love to read a review from anyone who has purchased this camera, the Aiptek Zoom DV-6 MP Image Stabilizing Camcorder w/3x Optical Zoom.  I see the claim that it has 3x OPTICAL zoom and cannot help but question this because I am unable to find this product on aiptek-dot-com and this cam has supposedly been available since July 30th, 2006.  Am wondering what gives with that?  

Please someone, post a review of this model and hopefully, some picture results too.  Let us know about this 3x optical zoom, please!    

I had to pick a rating, so the four star rating was based on the MPVR version of this camera -- which I own and find to be a very decent gadget.  Mine is over a year old and still going strong - no problems with that model.  MP3's sound terrific.  I convert movies for viewing on the camera while on the go and... "wow" for its quality.  I have recorded sounds and more.  Very decent!  Just drag and drop my files from my PC to the SD card and I can switch out movies and MP3's.  I am happy with that model, but it does not have any optical zoom - just digital.  Still get pretty good pix tho, just use the various settings...  My little homemade movies are good, very decent, but without additional lighting, indoor movies will be dark.  This camera doesnt handle well in strong sun - I use an umbrella over my cam as I film.  Big diff.  

So, is this newer model really all that much better?  Can't wait to know!  3x optical sounds good..

After researching several cameras in this price range, I bought the Rebel T2 last month. It has met my expectations and perhaps then some. After recently trying out a friends camera in the 150.-ish range, I partially regret spending what I did. It all comes down to what you need, want, and how many bells and whistles you like. For the money though, compared to the competitors, I still think I made a good purchase. After all, if I use it for ten years, which I most likely will, I will have surely got my moneys worth. Bottom line: no complaints with it

I bought a Canon Powershot A70. They say your best camera is the one you use most, and man I use it. I'm a high schooler, so I dont have much money, but with the A70, I can attach this adapter (LA-DC52C) to my camera, and I can have more photographic freedom with lenses, for alot less money. YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS ADAPTER FIRST. Then any lense which fits (most), can be used... GOOD IDEA CANON!!!

I so love the size and shape of this camera. This one takes some good pictures, and appear to be quite clear. It's better than the integrated camera on my cell phone. This camera may seem like it's taken a poor quality image, but when you transfer them onto a pc, they seem so clear! However it is recommended that you get a memory card for this camera as it only has 14mb of internal memory. As this camera was a gift to me, I'd have to say it was the best birthday present I have received

yes this is a very good first camcorder. i am a first time user of any cam corder. 

i have olny had mine for a month or so but i have made several films with it and it is very inersting. 

but the software is harder to use that movie maker.

but if you are a first time buyer then i would go for this becasuse 20GB is engough to use..

but the battery life is short but u wont need to make a feature length film!!!

it is just fantastic.

Well, this lens does work wonderfully to expand your angle for better shots, but if you don't have good lighting, you end up with pictures that are worthless.  I suggest never using this in poor indoor lighting as the flash that comes on the DX6490 does not clear the top of the wide angle lens and therefore becomes useless.  Best for outdoor shots or areas where overhead and backlighting are sufficient enough to take pictures without the use of a flash.  Plan ahead before just attatching the lens and taking pictures.  Also remember that because you can't use the flash option, you will need to stabilize the camera better to avoid blurry shots.  Otherwise, this lens is excellent.  It fits easily into my camera bag, is simple to attach (with the lens converter of course) and takes great shots without the fisheye effect.  Other than the inability to use my flash with the lens, I think it is great

Multi-element add-on lense used with Kodak DX-7590 provides good wide-angle capability.  Note that this is a very large add-on lense (screws into DX-7590 extension-piece which costs an additional $20).  Does the job well in most portraiture and scenic applications, however two caveats:
(1) Slight curvature of field in extreme corners of wide-angle shots (ie, corners of shots may be noticeably out of focus).   Suggest cropping to 95% of original picture to maintain sharpness across plane.
(2) Size of lense will render pop-up flash and outside the lense focusing system (Ultra-sonic) less functional.

This cable came in a cheap packing and it does not have any logo on it so you can't say which company it belongs to. I have used a lot of sony products and I feel it is not up to the standard of sony. 
It works great had no problems so far. It is flexible kinds so you don't have to worry about positioning your laptop according to your TV.

This camera case fits the camera perfectly and the extra battery is a MUST.  The price of the two items together is the same as the battery alone in local electronics stores.  So, I look at it as getting the case for free!

So far, I really love this camera.  It's very user friendly and gives you the option to put it in a VERY BASIC mode or normal mode.  What attracted me to purchasing this camera was because of the long battery life and because of the picture quality.  It has a large viewing area which is nice and it's very clear.  I recommend this camera

I've had other 3 digital cameras and this is the best I think, I shots very quick, flash is brighty, and even soft flash for more natural shots.

can browse pictures very fast and is has a lot of posibilities to edit inside the camera, is light tiny and slim.

one of the best cameras.

I don't find a negative feature on it.  I love it

I've had this digital camera for almost a year. It's the fourth camera I've owned. I spent quite some time searching for a compact camera that I could carry everywhere. Being an amateur photographer (and mostly taking pictures for myself and not others), I didn't want to lug around an extra bag just for my camera. It fits discreetly in your pocket or a small purse (for formal nights out). The size and weight of this camera is its best feature, and this carries through to the newer generations of this camera, too. 

This has been the perfect camera for everything from selling items on-line to landscape scenery. My pictures have always turned out beautifully, with wonderful color and crispness. I have discovered that the "automatic" lighting feature is not always the most ideal, but you can re-program just about anything on this camera.  

It's really quite a good camera, and given its price these days with the newer generations out there, it's a steal

After springing for the Cybershot in August so I could have a compact camera I would actually TAKE places, I've been very, very pleased. 

The last camera I had was an older Sony DSC that was quite bulky, ran on batteries, and had shutter problems--but it took great quality pictures and the interface and features were perfect, so I thought I would go for the DSCT5, since it avoids ALL of those problems. Only a tiny battery to charge, no sticky shutter... and it's sexy as hell. The screen is huge and very bright. 

I hate taking pictures with flash in general, and I find that the flash makes nasty redeye more often than not with this camera. (And the camera gives you the impression you cant change shutter speed or anything) However! You can easily change this by going into the over/under exposure options and under exposing your photos when you are in dark environments. They come out surprisingly well and blur-free

I don't think anybody is going to pretend that the little Casio Exilim EX-Z600 6.0 mega pixel camera is the best camera ever built or takes the best pictures in the world.  But for under $[...], it's hard to beat and does everything advertised.

The size is perfect, one of the smallest, slimmest cameras made, easily fitting into one's [...] pocket, even when enclosed in a small case.  The viewing screen is probably the biggest and brightest you'll find, so aiming and shooting is easy as it can be.  The range of modifications (size, contrast, sharpness, saturation, etc.) to taking and managing pictures seems almost endless, yet the various menus the camera offers are simple to navigate.  And the camera's docking stand makes downloading pictures to one's computer as well as charging up the camera a snap.  Moreover, according to Casio, a single charge will afford one up to 500 or more snaps.

Picture quality?  It's perhaps not as absolutely clear and well defined, even at its maximum six mega pixels, as the best cameras; although, to be fair, the best cameras often cost three-to-four times as much as this one.  So, as far as I'm concerned, I've no complaints, and the pictures I've been taking are a delight to the eye.  The Z600 makes picture-taking fun again

Some reviewers below have said that this microphone doesn't work with the Sony hot shoe.  Wrong.  Click on the "Technical Details" on this page and you'll see the Sony Camcorder models that this microphone works with.

Failure to look at which camcorders are compatable with this microphone is the fault of the customer, not any fault with the microphone!  So don't give it a low rating based on your own lack of research when buying a product, please

This camera case is great.  It's very small and fits my coolpix 4600 perfectly.  There is enough room to fit an extra memory card and some batteries (but the batteries make it tight).  I originally purchased the camera case listed for the 4600, but it was a little bulky and the zipper could scratch the camera if you aren't careful.  This camera case does not come with a strap like the other, but that is something I would never use.  I highly recommend this case for those who want a small sleek case to protect their camera.

I bought this camera just before a trip to CA and then a cruise!  It is very easy to operate (even for a techno-retard like me) and the pictures turned out great!  I have started to use the filming feature recently as my Video Recorder is with my son @ college and I want to film my daughter's Drill Team performances!  I really like the fact that it doesn't turn on while in my purse!!!  My old camera did that a couple of times, and I ended up with quite a few pictures of the contents of my purse - anyone want one? (LOL) All in all, a great buy!  8 months later and the LCD display is gone!  Literally, GONE!  Don't know what happened - took pictures/movies of daughter's drill team performance, and when I got it out again to take pictures before Sadie Hawkins, it would still take pictures (I just downloaded them) but since the display looks like "a piece of plaid fabric with a marijuana leaf coming in from the right side" I don't know what I'm taking a picture of!  Need to replace soon!  I'm (now) bummed

Celestron's tool is easy to carry, easy to use, and (at least in my case!) gives me quick, precision collimation with my Newtonian.  Why pay for a laser collimator (which needs to be calibrated) when you can use this?

Collimation is the most important part of your setup; without good mirror alignment, all you'll see are blobs and blurs even on the best viewing nights.  This combination tool makes aligning both primary and secondary mirrors fairly painless, and also fairly fast.  Highly recommended for any level of observer

Very good camera. This was a present for my wife as she needed a new camera. She picked it out and liked that it came as a complete kit. Directions can be hard to follow at times and could be printed larger. Takes some getting used to. Zoom lense works great and takes good pictures. Where the on-off button is so close to the shutter, you have to be careful that you don't accidentally shut the camera off. She is very satisfied with it.

I'm pleased with the purchase. I bought this camera just under two years ago when I was getting ready for a trip abroad.

I spent six months in England, with five weeks travelling around Europe with this camera in its case on my belt. It's very sturdy if nothing else, between the trains, planes, hostels, and general bustle I'm very pleased with how well it held up. Nothing on it broke.

I probably took at least 400 pictures during my trip, if not more. Sure I've had to swap out batteries on one or two occasions in the two years I've had it, but my general feeling is that the batteries are holding up quite well.

The zoom on this camera is very nice. It's one of the better zooms I've seen on a simple camera of this type, or at least it was back when I bought it.

It also has several features that older film cameras do not, such as a timer that you can set before running to get in your own picture, or settings to take "Portraits" or "Night shots."

I know that this camera cannot compare to professional cameras, I know that it doesn't have all the frills of the new digital cameras, and I am not trying to compare it to those. I'm not a professional photographer, so I don't know how to use a camera with exchangable lenses and whatnot. I don't want a digital for personal and professional reasons. For a traditional film camera, this one is the best I've ever used.

BOTTOM LINE: Good quality photos, a sturdy build, excellent zoom lens, useful and easy to use features, and long battery life make this camera an excellent choice if you want a traditional film camera with a few perks

I bought this camera more than half a year ago. My intention was to get a decent camera for images, but then also be able to use it for filming short movies.

I'm very pleased with its performance. In good lighting conditions, colors come out to be amazing. I really really did not expect them to be so vivid and sparkling! In darker conditions, well, it still works fine, not nearly as bad as I expected from some other reviews. Photos might be grainy or not as vivid anymore, but the stuff is still perfectly suitable to show the photos to people.

As about filming, it's terrific. I mean, resolution is great (sth like 848 by 640 or so), better than what one could possibly expect from a regular camera. And the quality is super awesome, looks very neat on computer screen. Respect.

It has to be pointed out that you cannot zoom while filming, but not many cameras out there can do that.

Oh, it's also very small with a gigantic screen and great battery life. A great buy

After setting booby traps for Zombies, I like to whip out my Bushnell Waterproof scope and wait for the oncoming herds to trample on in.  This scope is just great because it cuts down on glare and is also waterproof.  It is good to have some foreward advancement of options when dealing with the zombies so when you are set up this scope can give you good range in spotting them on your trail!!

This spotting scope from Bushnell is an excellent buy if you are an outdoors person or if you like watching the world from your window.

You can even view the craters on the moon.

Plus it's waterproof and comes with two cases and a tripod.

The amazon price is the best deal on the internet

Proving that there's life in the old dog yet, Bushnell have come up with this, the successor to the out-dated, poor-performing Trophy Splashproof Spotting Scope, and I have to say, it's a fantastic improvement. As soon as I took it out of the box I was impressed with its styling, shape, colour, and of course, waterproofness. I set it up in my front room and spent a happy couple of hours watching my neighbours coming and going, and they were oblivious to my surveillance. It's not the most subtle 'scope out there but stick a blanket over your head and you're laughing. Any one who has been caught out in the rain will appreciate this little beauties moulded plastic housing, as water really does roll off it like, erm, water off a duck's back. Stunning

This adapter is the only one available for the HD1 and while it does a good job of protecting the 1st lense with whichever 49 mm one you attach, there is a problem when you use the flash for pictures of things within 10 feet. There will be a dark semicircle on the bottom of your pictures where the flash was blocked by the adapter. I've gotten around this by using the adapter with attached lens and lens cap and having that attached to the string on the camera. whenever I need to take a picture with the flash of something up close (within 10 feet) I pop off the whole setup and take the picture as if the entire piece was a giant lens cap for the regular camera. Hope that helps

I liked this lens. I used it, for the first time, while traveling through Peru. It was light-weight and easy to use. At 200mm, most of my pictures turned out great, especially when I was on steady ground (taking pictures from a rocking boat with no tripod is a bit of a challenge!). I've printed some 8x10's of close-ups I took using this lens and I was quite impressed with the quality. It was also in my price range. Overall, I'd say it was a "good bang for the buck.

I enjoy all the features of this item.

The main compartment that hold the camera is soft and secure. You can open it without worrying about your camera falling off.

The back compartment is roomy enough for all the basic gear. The slot for memory cards 1-4 (depends on the card type), batteries (roomy for four AA), and cables can fit in it.

The shoulder strap is basic and looks flimsy. It's not long enough to hold comfortable diagonally but on the side is good. The belt loop is very secure and can fit on belt three inch in width.

It can even handle the worst environment ever. Hot, dry climate with sandstorms and occasional accidental drops. It has protected my dig. camera very well

After springing for the Cybershot in August so I could have a compact camera I would actually TAKE places, I've been very, very pleased. 

The last camera I had was an older Sony DSC that was quite bulky, ran on batteries, and had shutter problems--but it took great quality pictures and the interface and features were perfect, so I thought I would go for the DSCT5, since it avoids ALL of those problems. Only a tiny battery to charge, no sticky shutter... and it's sexy as hell. The screen is huge and very bright. 

I hate taking pictures with flash in general, and I find that the flash makes nasty redeye more often than not with this camera. (And the camera gives you the impression you cant change shutter speed or anything) However! You can easily change this by going into the over/under exposure options and under exposing your photos when you are in dark environments. They come out surprisingly well and blur-free

I deal in major brand cameras and Panasonic cameras are my personal favorite! I've seen people whine about the "noise" they make many times but have never found it to be a problem. I own the FZ10 and the FX01 for my personal cameras. The FX01 is a very fast camera and takes great pics! I love the 28mm wide lens. Compared to most cameras I've used the FX01 does a real good job of metering the light and exposing the images. 

I love Panasonic's solid build and reliability. They may not be as popular as Canon or Sony but in my opinion are every bit as good.

I bought this for my wife so she could pull out the camera, turn it on, and take a nice photo.  Flash works well, unlike some reviews I've read.  Battery life appears to be fine also.  This is a small, light camera, measuring 3 1/2" wide, 2 1/4 " tall, and 3/4" deep when turned off. Not exactly a credit card, but likely as close to one as you're gonna get.    Camera opens up instantly, takes a nice photo whether with or without flash, battery life appears OK, and controls are easy to use--either in figuring them out or using your fingers on them.  Nice big screen 2 1/4 by 1 1/2, so you can easily see what's going on--a nice plus.  This camera also has a nice "reminder" listing on the right of the display, so you can see flash setting (on, off, etc.), ISO setting for those of you that use that, and VERY NICE way to access the other controls shown for the auto focus, self-timer, antishake, ISO sensitivity, white background (am I losing you yet?), and so on.  One point to remember is that this listing is arranged from most-likely-to-use to least-likely, so the user interface has been a strong consideration in the design of this camera.  

I've gotten some nice pictures with this, with and without flash.  A nice pick.  

Why not 5 stars?  cuz I've also bought a more expensive digital camera that gives me more choices, although for the price this camera is fine and it'd be one I'd buy again, but it isn't the equal of dig cams with 6x optical zooms, separate ISO settings, and all those other techie things that, frankly, aren't that important to a lot of users but which do need to be considered in a rating.

Do buy a carrying case, as I have done, so the camera doesn't get scratched or lost cuz it'z so small. I don't have any "special fear" about this but it's also easy to buy a small carrying case to stash this into, so why not do it?  

As in all my reviews, I have no financial interest one way or the other in what I review.  

Also, don't forget you are likely to want a bigger memory card to store pix, and maybe a second battery to swap out when needed.  Consider these additional costs, but also consider these additional costs apply to any camera you buy.

I have own this camcorder for 6 month
it's a good camcorder, esay to use, easy to bring
As it's design purpose, PC-55 is enough for home use
Only one thing I want to mention here, before I buy this camcorder, I thought that I can record video on MS duo in mepg format, and it's easy for post-edit on PC, you know, tansfer a MiniDV tape to computer may need a huge space to save.
However, when I replay the video which stored on MS, the sreen was full of mosaic
fortunately, when use DV type to record, this situation never happens. good quality.
The one press photo button also becomes useless because the bad quality

I've had this camcorder for a week now and I think it works great .. except for the touch screen feature. That takes a little getting used to .. especially when accessing the special features (such as fader effects) while filming.

The digital still quality is poor when recording directly to the memory stick .. but the same images taken as a still from prerecorded tape is much clearer.

All in all it is a good product .. just takes some getting used to

Great camera . . . one of the few lower priced cams to keep the mic jack and the headphone jack,  but beware . .. . this camera does NOT come with a lens cap, and NO remote control.  other sources state that this camera does NOT have a Leica lens.  This camera does NOT have A/V input.  No flash, no hot accessory shoe (though it has one which has no power).  No widescreen LCD.  It does record in widescreen but no image stabilization in widescreen.

This is my first camcorder, so I don't have much to compare it to, but I've enjoyed it so far. It's easy to use. The picture quality seems high.  The only minor problem I've found is with the headphone input.  Had to try three different sets of headphones before I could find one that would fit into the narrow slot where the headphone jack is

This is one of the best camcorders in the market today and I would definitely recommend it to anyone planning to buy a Mini-DV camcorder 

Positive factors: 
- Very small and easy to hold with one hand. Can be easily attached even to a mini-tripod with ease. 
- Excellent widescreen video and hi-fi audio. Your videos finally get that "Hollywood" feel when you shoot movies in 16:9 ratio (widescreen format). Even if you don't have a widescreen TV currently, you will very soon have one as more and more people are buying them. So its better to buy this camcorder and shoot in 16:9 format to enjoy your movies later in widescreen format. 
- Includes widescreen rotatable LCD so what you see is what you get when you shoot in 16:9 ratio (widescreen format) 
- Good battery life. One extra battery is enough. You can easily manage a day's worth of shooting with two batteries before recharging them again 
- Includes docking station making it easier to connect to computer or TV. If you have a good computer with a firewire port, please buy a firewire cable to connect the camcorder to your computer. You can download your movie in excellent clarity in .avi format and edit it as required 
- Make sure to change the audio setting to 16 bit (instead of the default 12 bit) for very good hi-fi audio 
- Touchscreen menu system is great. You don't have to search for any buttons as they are all available in the touchscreen menu itself. 
- 10X optical zoom is more than sufficient for ordinary home videos. Anything more produces more "shaking" and would necessiate the use of a tripod. When you shoot without a tripod, 10X is the best zoom you can achieve without worrying about shaky videos 
- Widescreen still photo. The photo clarity is OK not too good. So please don't expect great shots. Since the photo is in 16:9 format, you can take panoramic photos and cover more people in group shots 
- Nightshot: Cool feature that records using infrared light. Useful for shooting at night as you can record a video even in 100% darkness 
- Color widescreen viewfinder - Very useful when you are running down on batteries and need to use the viewfinder. The color widescreen viewfinder gives an excellent picture and is as good as the LCD in clarity 

Negative factors: 
- Outdoor videos especially in bright sunlight are overexposed. So please adjust the white balance when shooting outdoors. Add the white-balance menu to your shortcuts so that you can easily access it and return to default once you start shooting indoors 
- Sensitive microphone may pick up button clicks (best to turn off the button click "beep" sound). 

Notes: 
- Use a fresh cassette after recording 2 or 3 times on the same cassette. The head tends to get dirty if you re-record on the same cassette more than 3 times 
- You can edit movies in Windowx XP using Windows Movie Maker, but beware it does not support 16:9 ratio video. Hence your videos look ugly as you shot them in 16:9 but Movie Maker converted it to 4:3. Invest in Pinnacle Software version 9 or 10 for better movie editing capabilities. Pinnacle is the only software, I am aware of, that preserves teh 16:9 ratio. Even Roxio could not allow 16:9 format. 
- You can also invest in wide-angle lens as it gives excellent coverage

I checked the 3CCD from Panasonic and the Canon camcorders. In that price range this is the best I found (if you have the extra money, the new HDV camcorder from Sony might be your best bet!).

IMPORTANT:The CCD issues referred in other user comments are REAL (although I don't know if it will also apply to this new model). It actually happened on my previous Sony. I purchased a 5 years warranty from Sony for my DCR-HC90. 5 years is a good product life so I will take the risk of CCD failure after that period and ENJOY this GREAT product until then!

Great features are: small but feels solid, 3 megapixel pictures (impressive quality for camcorder), incredible low light performance, nice touch screen, great features. Battery life is actually not too bad from original battery but you might need an extra.

What I did not like: CANNOT take full size pictures in camera mode (only in memory mode), limited zoom compared to most new camcorders and lots of required extra (SVideo cable, ILink cable, video light, decent size memory stick, extended warranty). I am still giving this a 5-stars overall.

A great add-on for the Xacti HD1, but two minor problems I've found so far. 1. I can't use a circular polarizing filter with the wide angle lens as it cuts off the corners of a picture and; 2. flash photography won't work as the  pop-up flash becomes obscured by the barrel of the add-on lens

The optical x6 zoom on the Canon A710 IS is already better than cameras in it s range (i.e. non SLR). However, the zoom takes the picture up to the natural size; the tele converter lens really does make a difference. 

Firstly, if there are any negatives, they are very minor; the lens and adapter are black - would have been nice to have been silver to match with the camera. Erm, that's it!

The main quality of Canon is the lens, which they always do well. The clarity of this lens is very good, with very little fuzziness at the edge. It also connects simply the adapter and seems fairly solid when connected. The electronics features help in the overall control of adding the attachment. The tele lens does make a difference for just getting that bit closer to get what you want.

I ordered this hoping that it would fit my camera and accessories and it did. I have a Stylus 750 plus a pop up screen shade, an extra battery, and an extra picture card. There are two slots specifically designed to fit two picture cards on the inside cover. In the main compartment, a small slit will fit an extra battery or two plus a creit card and perhaps a bit of paper money. (It won't fit much more than that, though.) It's compact, stylish and functional--I'm glad I bought it

This is Panasonic's entry-level camcorder, but it's packed with useful features, like good image quality, 12 lux sensitivity, and a whopping 30x optical zoom.  I think it's perfect for casual travel videography as well as for shooting entries to the "America's Funniest Video" show.  It's fairly easy to use and the build quality is solid.

A good optional accessory to get is a spare battery.  You never know if the battery might run out at the most inopportune time, so be sure to pick up a backup one.  Given the recent Dell recall of 4.1 million laptops due to battery fire, you should get a genuine Panasonic LiIon battery designd specifically for this model.  Don't put your life or your loved one's at risk.

The reviewer named "Hung" got it totally wrong (or was just plain lying).  The GS29 does come with IEEE1394 Firewire (aka i.Link) so you can download your videos quickly to your PC; if your PC doesn't already have an IEEE1394 port, you can get a PCI IEEE1394 card for $30 or less.  You can use Windows Movie Maker, included with Windows ME and XP, to edit your videos and export them to CDs or DVDs.

After reading the reviews here and at [...] on this baby, I was a little cocerned about its low-light and indoor performance.  Let me be the first to say that my fears were largely unfounded.

Yes, if you film in very low light, it will darken many colors.  But we're talking 60 lux, which is the roughly equivalent to the light put off from the candles of a birthday cake.  Just keep the lights on when your kid blows out the candles, and viola!  Seriously, I have had absolutely no problems with it filming too dark indoors, outdoors, or even when I film local bands playing in dark bars.

The reason I wanted to try this camera was because it is the only flash-based camera that is receiving even mildly positive reviews.  I do not want a tape mechanism that will break, nor a fragile hard drive that cannot be used in many film-worthy conditions (think snow skiing, as the drive mechanism will freeze up on you in very cold weather).  

As I said, I was skeptical when I purchased it, but no more.  The videos are far better than any other camcorder I've owned.  My last was a Canon ZR 50 mini DV, and this camera takes VASTLY superior videos than that one.

The four stars is only because of the mpeg2 format this records to.  I have a mac, so editting requires that I convert to DV with streamclip so that imovie can import the movies.  Mainly, I just don't edit my home videos so that hasn't been a problem.  But if would have been nice for it to be an easier option, and it could have been if they encoded to mpeg4 with h264 and mp3/aac, which appears to be the next standard.  

If that concerns you, or if you want HD, you might wait until the Panasonic SD1 is available because it records in AVHDC which is a form of mpeg4.  Of course, imovie doesn't yet support that either, so you may have to wait until iLife 07 to really use it.  

In parting, I will also mention that the size of this unit is absolutely fabulous.  I no longer dread lugging around even my smallish mini DV camera.  This thing literally fits in my jacket pocket, so I end up filming a lot more than I did with previous cameras.  If you're looking for small, flash-based, and good quality video, get this camera, you'll love it

I was looking specifically for the magic combination of an all-around video and still camera that was compact and built very solid that I can travel with easily.  I have had this camera since Dec 19th, 2006.

I had very bad luck with my previous camera, a Canon Elura that used MiniDVs.  When it worked, the videos were great, but the cassette mechanism kept falling out of adjustment and failing on trips or gatherings, and I lost many unrecoverable moments!  I had an extended warranty and sent it back 3 times, but they were never able to fix it properly. Perhaps this was an unusual lemon, but I did not want to take the chance again! Of the many media types, I've been told the SD cards are the most durable and almost indestructable.  I liked the idea of no moving parts for recording videos.

In addition, I was tired of having a separate digital and video camera, and the technology has finally arrived to combine the two.

For the non-professional camera person looking to catch candid home and travel shots and videos, I've found this is to be a great little camera.  It is amazingly small, and really will fit in a coat pocket. Extremely solid, it is also a snap to use, yet still provides powerful manual override abilities.  The camera turns on within a few seconds.  The video colors are extremely natural and not oversaturated in any way, and the resolution very fine.  The microphone works well, and of course there is no "tape hiss" since there is no tape.  The still photos are of fair quality. I printed some at 8 x 10 and they looked decent: However, if very-high quality photos are what you are after this is NOT the camera for you. Again, this is definitely for the snap-and-shoot-for-memories crowd, not for people who want to win photography awards. The miniscule pop-up flash is amazingly powerful.

I also looked at the Sanyo which has a competing SD model with a higher still photo resolution ability, but it does not have any motion compensation ability. Given how small these cameras are, it is not possible to hand-hold without jiggling it a lot, so I ruled the Sanyo out.

Okay, now the negatives.  There are quite a few, but for what it does I still found this to be the best camera for my purposes:

(1) The camera does not record well in low-light conditions, I'm sure due to the light required for 3CCD color processing and the small size of the lens (cost of being compact!). Filming indoors requires pretty good light to ensure decent videos.  My christmas tree light pictures were disappointing, and my backlit scenes came out looking like shadow-puppet plays.
(2) The cost of buying additional 4GB cards is high, and I am worried about misplacing them because they are so small.
(3) I experienced wide swings in over- and under-exposed still photos using the flash, although I was (usually) able to balance the brightness and contrast with my photo editor.  I'm sure this is partly due to not being used to the camera yet, but the whole idea is not to have to worry about such things.  Flash fill-in on backlit subjects works amazingly well.
(4) The LCD display on the camera is not synchronized to the same level of brightness and contrast as your TV set or your PC, which you will have to adjust upwards during playback. Thankfully, my Sony TV allows custom adjustments for each input source. Ditto when you are creating DVD's...you will need to increase the brightness and contrast to match what you see when playing back a scene through the camera's own LCD viewer.
(5) There is no still photo zoom playback on the camera (at least I have not found it yet). Frequently, I think a snapped photo comes out okay, only to realize when "zooming" the image on the pc to review the details that it is slightly blurry and I need to retake it.
(6) You will need to use the included software to view the MPEG2 videos, as MPEG2 is not an included driver in the editing tools I've reviewed.  
(7) There was no still photo editing software included, only video software. I supposed Panasonic assumes  everyone has their own photo editing software already, but I didn't.  My Canon photo editing software works for these photos, so I am using that.
(8) Finally, the battery fits inside an enclosed compartment, so you are not able to buy an extended battery pack. Since there is no energy required for running a hard drive, DVD burner or tape, admittedly the batteries seem to last longer before recharging, but I still can't see taking a trip with less than 2-3 packs.  I guess I will be spending extra on more batteries!

Even with these drawbacks, there is no doubt that this is an amazing sleek winner with really no competitor in its class that I intend to use heavily at home and on my travels

[Below is my recent review of the JVC Everio GZ-MG40, which has a 20GB hard drive rather than 30GB. Becase GZ-MG50 seems to be identical to GZ-MG40 save the hard drive capacity, I thought this review would be useful to those considering to buy GZ-MG50.]


----------------------------------------

I have been using this camcorder for almost two weeks now. And here are my impressions:

PROS:

A) This is a tiny camcorder and I can easily carry it in my pocket everyday.

B) It records directly on a [30GB] harddrive. This is probably the most amazing feature of this camera. It has the following amazing benefits: 
    (1) A huge recording space 
    (2) Random access to recorded videos when browsing 
       (through a thumblist of videos) 
    (3) Super fast transfer onto your computer through USB 2.0. 
    (4) No tapes, no CDs, no DVDs to worry about while recording video.
    (5) Facilitates easy archiving/organizing . For example, all the recorded files on the camera's harddrive have  "creation date"s as a part of their file information. When the camera is connected to your computer, you can sort all files by date and easily separate all recordings by date to different folders by simply selecting and dragging. (This is extra, but if you want to index and be able to search your video files, say with google desktop, simply enter a list of keywords in the file name about the contents of the file.) 
    (6) The harddrive on your camera can double as additional portable storage media- this is unlikely but If you wanted you could even install linux on it and  carry with you an operating system on your camera.

C) Video quality is good for a consumer level video camera. The sound quality recorded through the internal microphone is good: i can hear the lectures I record very clearly and there is no annoying noise generated by the camera.

D) The charger that comes with this camera is very small. So you can carry that around as well and worry less about running out of battery.


CONS:

A) No mic jacks.
B) manual focus and light adjustments are done through menus.
C) The editing software that comes with it is  limited.
D) The battery life is a mere hour(but you can buy a 3 hour battery for 70-80 dollars).


As with all camcorders, the still images shot with this camera are not at the level of quality you can get from a good still camera. It produces reasonable snapshots in well lit situations.

The video files recorded by this camera have a ".MOD" extension in their name. I replace ".MOD" with  ".MPG" and most of my standard video viewing software automatically recognize the files

Love my new JVC Everio.  The original model just used compact flash cards, but the new Everio GZ uses an ipod like hard drive that lets you store a year's worth of video on it!  Tape is definitely dead, and DVD camcorder's 30 mintues a disc doesn't hold a candle to the Everio.

The only issue I had was that the software that come with it was pretty basic, but all the other video editing software programs didn't recognize the Everio video files (.mod files which contain MPEG2 Video and Dolby Stereo Audio).  

I did finally find Adobe Premiere Elements 2.0 which supports this new file type natively.  It has made editing a breeze.

I've been waiting for this technology for years.  So when I found out JVC was planning on coming out with their 4 GB microdrive version, I had to have one.  The $1500 price tag was too much though.  Then I found out the GZ-MG50 was coming out, and would be about a $1000.  I thought it was still a little pricey, but I couldn't wait any longer.

So far, the camera has performed great.  It's been easy to use and easy to transfer the files to my computer then to DVD.  However, the video editing software that came with it seems a bit cheap, but it gets the job done.  Maybe the next gen version will be an improvement.

The movie quality is very good.  I won't give it a "Great" because I occasionally see pixel blurring when watching my burned DVDs. 

Don't bother taking pictures with this, unless you only plan on emailing them.  The quality is far too low to use to capture those precious moments.

I recommend getting an additional battery (the three hour model).  The one hour battery just doesn't cut it, especially if you want to review your scenes while you're out shooting. 

If JVC gave the camcorder a larger CCD and included better software, I would have given this a 5 star rating, otherwise I think they are on the right track, and in a few years, the MiniDV may be as forgotten as the eight-track.

I went the (thinking it was cheaper) eBay route- for about $10 more  I got a new one here and it WORKS. eBay is nice, but when it comes to stuff like this I learned my lesson. I've never gone wrong ordering from Amazon, in fact I just ordered an OEM NB-3L battery for my SD500; tried the Radio Slop route and it won't go over 20 pictures. Again, shame on me for trying to go cheap

I have looked everywhere for this charger.  Everywhere in town wants me to buy something else that MIGHT work.  It was great to finally find the actual charger that comes with the camera.  It's just the right size and plugs right into the wall.  The prongs fold down and can fit nicely in a carry-on bag.  THANKS so much for having this item available

Good camera for the $129 I paid. Does everything pretty well, and your picture modes are pretty customizable. Only qualm is it takes a second or two longer than I wish when the camera saves/loads pictures to the memory card. Might be a problem when trying to shoot consecutive pictures-- but probably wouldn't be doing it with this type of camera anyways.

I have several different binoculars from small hand held to a large pair of Nikon's I use for wildlife spotting.    I have never had anything that performs nearly as well as these do.  

I am a serious nature and wildlife photographer that has used high end Canon photography equipment for years.   When I saw a Image Stabilized binocular was available with "L" glass, (This is the symbol that Canon uses to identify their finest optics in camera lenses),  I bought them immediately.    

These binoculars are a little bit heavier than a non stabilized pair,  but the weight is easily compensated by the stabilizer.    Once you press the stabilizer button,  the scene will lock, and the effect is amazing.     I tested them by looking at a sign about 100 yards away.   With my normal hand shake I could not read the sign at that distance.    As soon I engaged the stabilizer,  the image locked into place and never once moved.    It performs as well as my camera lenses.  

As far as the optics,  they are, in my opinion second to none in the world.  The image is significantly brighter than any other set I have,  and the calrity and sharpness is incredible.   The night viewing capabilities are incredible. 

Finally, a huge plus is that these binoculars are completely fog and weather sealed.    Change amibient temps, use them in the rain, and the will not allow condensation to get into the unit.  A wonderful feature for those of us that use our equipment in other than nice weather.


Things to be aware of include:

These are relatively large,  which suit a medium to large hand size.   If you have very small hands, your may not like the feel of the unit in your hands. 

Second, the lens caps do not perform well.   They simple do not stay on the unit.     Although for me this is not a serious issue, it is the one area that Canon could have done a much better job.   You can get around this issue by attaching a good uv filter to the lenses.  (You should probably do this anyway to protect the glass)

Finally,  the strap the the carry case comes with is poor.    It is too thin to be comfortably worn for extended use.   I would recommend you find a really comfortable aftermarket camera strap to use with these.   

SUMMARY: 

Outstanding performance and quality.    A little larger fell in your hands than some people may like,  but once you learn to use them, I do not believe any serious birdwatcher or sports fan would ever let them go!    I give the Canon L binoculars a 5 Star rating.

I waited a long time for Canon to come out with image-stabilized binoculars in a 100% waterproof design.  These were worth the wait.  I bought mine specifically for a cruise up Alaska's Inside Passage.  One of our sight-seeing excursions was on a 45-foot boat in heavy seas.  A fellow on this trip had a massive set of Fujinon 16x40 Gyro-Stabilized binoculars that sell for nearly $6,000.  We spent time comparing my Canon binoculars to his Fujinons.  Optically there is NO comparison.  The Canons, while not as superb optically as the best Leica binoculars, are awfully good.  They are far brighter, much sharper, and more accurate in their color rendition than the Fujinons.  The ONLY reason to spend an extra $4,500+ on the Fujinons is if you require the absolute best image stabilization that money can buy.  If you are using binoculars in very severe conditions (high seas, etc.) you will get better performance with the gyro-stabilization in the Fujinons.  In 99% of applications you will get far better results with the Canons.  Though the Fujinons are higher in their rated magnification the only time you'll see a difference is under conditions where motion is severe.  In calmer seas (not calm, just not severe) you will be better off with the Canons; the Fuji's are so much dimmer and lacking in clarity that the Canons make up the magnification difference fairly quickly.

Finally, the waterproof aspect of these binoculars really is worth having.  On the above-mentioned trip we were buffeted by rain and spray from the waves.  The Canons functioned flawlessly without a hitch, and cleaned up nicely afterwards.  These are one of the best products I've ever used, and lived up to their performance claims in every regard.

One point to note: if you want the maximum battery life it is well worth buying lithium AA batteries to use with these binoculars; this will greatly extend your battery life, particularly in cold weather

i just got my new camcorder and start to operate it. first of all is's very easy to operate with the joystick, the use in the still image function is allways available, even while shooting a video (nice feature but as all camcorders - low quality pitures) the stabalizer (one of the reason why i'd preffered that cam over the other) is great and even in full zoom you can get pretty steady videos. the large zoom (X32) is also very nice. overall i think this is great value for my money....

Loved this! It is awesome because it is BOTH land and sea camera, so you need just one! You can get tons of accessories and flashes for it. It is easy to use and the program it comes with allows you to do all kinds of cool corrections INCLUDING making your photos MORE in focus in case you shot them blurry!

I cannot wait to use it again, well UNDERWATER for diving I mean

Works well, especially for anyone who still has their old console systems in use. I have my NES and SNES, both of which have huge AC adapters, plugged into this. It saves tons of space on my power strip.

The design is a little clumsy though, so it's only getting 4/5

It's speedy and space saving and inexpensive. I bought this to replace my Belkin because the Belkin needed to be plugged in. This one is powered by your computer so there's no extra power cords, which is a big plus to me. 

The only thing I dislike about this is the fact that the Hub takes up two Usb ports instead of just one like the Belkin.

I've had a number of universal remotes over the years and each has had pluses and minuses to offer. The monster remote is a very effective universal remote on all accounts but there is ONE thing that stands out here above all the other remotes. Wireless control over lighting. I replaced my dimmers and switches with the Monster dimmers and switches and now I can control every light in my house. Monster really doesn't talk much about this feature but being able to hit "ALL OFF" at night on my way to bed and have the remote turn off all the house lights is killer. You can even map ligthing scenes to activities. If you hit watch a movie it can turn down the ligths at the same time. Really cool. Good job monster.

I really don't have much to say about this book holder, not that it's just a book holder.  It's a nice one.  It does it's job.  It's a little too expensive for just a piece of plastic.

It's strong, sturdy, and it's big enough, even for those massive heavy textbooks, like the Calculus ones.  Although, I would not recommend putting a dictionary or reference that's like 6" thick (even though it still may hold).  It's got little clamps at the bottom to prevent the page from flipping all over the place, although those tend to fall off when you move them.  But that's no big deal.  Just put them back on.  

This book holder is kind of big, and I would not put it on a small desk in the middle of a classroom, but it's not too big.  You should be able to put it almost anywhere when studying on your own time.

After using my iM716s for about 4 months now I have a few things to say about them.

1) Price: Lists for $199 on Altec's site.  $70 is a steal.
2) Quality: Top notch in the earphones, the clip on the volume module is weak.
3) Performance: Bar none best I've had.  These things outperform the huge Logitech ear muff set I use mainly to mow in.  These things allow me to mow the lawn without having to jack up the volume to drown out the mower.
4) Conclusion: The only thing that stops me from saying these are perfect is the volume module can be a pain and get in the way.  When moving around, you NEED to have it clipped to something, otherwise it can create inner ear noise.  This can get quite annoying.  I've also caught the cord on things, causing the clip to bend away from the module.  It is removeable and I was able to bend it back.  If there were a pair of equal quality w/o the module, even for the same price, I'd go that route.  With that said, I am in no way regretting my purchase and will recommend these to anyone asking me about them or my 60GB video ipod

I installed this unit on my HP AMD 64 X2 with a 19-inch LCD monitor.  Installation was very straightforward, with no problems experienced.  The unit has two rows of power outlets - eight outlets total.  All are surge protected, but only one row has battery backup.  Each row includes an outlet that is offset to allow transformer power supplies to be connected and still accommodate use of the other outlets.  The unit also surge protects the incoming telephone line, and interacts well transparently my DSL service.

The unit comes with a USB connector cable that is used to transfer information between the unit and the computer.  Also included is "PowerChute Personal Edition" software.  This software replaces the UPS option used under the "Power" icon of Widow's XP Control Panel.  PowerChute PE allows user selection of alarms and power options to best fit the user's needs.  PowerChute PE automatically loads at computer startup, and resides as an icon on the right-side of the Window's task bar.  It monitors the unit's status, and provides information concerning abnormal power events that have occurred for future reference.

In order to assure that there is enough battery power for this unit to operate properly, I only attached the PC and monitor to the powered row of outlets.  Transformers seem to use a lot of power, and to gain the most time available for adequate shut-down times they should only be plugged into the "surge only" outlet row.

When A/C power fails, the unit immediately picks up the power load.  It will then begin to shut down the PC if A/C power does not become available shortly .  The default method it uses is to place the PC into "hibernation mode", saving the desktop exactly "as is" for future start-up.  It accomplished this task with my PC perfectly.

If I had wanted a UPS to keep my computer running for several minutes during an A/C power outage, this is not the unit I would have purchased.  However, to keep my system from re-booting due to the power being interrupted momentarily, or to shut down the PC safely should the power outage last longer, this is a cost-effective solution for those tasks.

I had two unworking disks (One a PS2 game and the other a PSX game) so I picked this up and both work fine now! The only thing is you'll have to run it through a couple times. If you run it through once you'll see little difference... But for the price and since it does work... eventually, I still give it a 5 out of 5.

What an amazing product for such a small price.  It works right out of the box, but to get full functionality you need to install the encolsed drivers.  The option of mouse or pen makes it useful for everyday PC work as well using the pen for graphics.  I use it mainly for teaching via phone and use the whiteboard in messenger to communicate in words and pictures.  It really makes a difference.
The unit seems well made and I like the fact you can personalise the tablet to add a picture of your choice.  I opted for the smallest in the range for value, and was not disappointed, but I am sure for more commerical use or for artwork a much bigger screen would be better, but at cost.
The software bundle is ok too if you don't already have photoshop tools.
The one quibble is that at home when I installed the drivers it continued to crash my PC with my wireless keyboard installed.  Not ideal, but as I dont use it at home any longer it is not a problem for me, but be careful, I am sure there will be a fix somewher

I got this card last month and I've been using it heavily. Its been great. Its sturdy and can has great range. There are a few problems though.

#1 There is no case for the card.
#2 The included browser only lasts for 30 days and its horrible. Luckily I had NetFront 3.1
#3 Memory Stick LAN software will occasionally error, but a soft reset will fix it.

Otherwise its a great little expansion card

I love my tooldial and its' software.  My only complaint is that you must have a very large proccessor to run it effectively.  I frequently find that it gums up photoshop and in-design a little.  Overall great product and I expect them to have some updates to work out the bugs.  Works very well in tandem with a WACOM tablet

This is a great card reader for the price. Why pay more if this one reads the all cards that you have? Personally, I only use CompactFlash and SD cards. It reads these cards and it does it fast and reliably.

The shape of this card reader is a bit awkward but then again it does help you grab the unit while inserting and removing cards, which you'll want to do a bit carefully. It would be a bit more difficult to do that with the unit lying flat on the desk. Remember to never force the card in and remember the label side faces towards the Sandisk logo on the card reader. It is slightly tricky to get the cards into the slots at first, but once you get the feel of it, it beccomes quite easy and routine.

This Sandisk has LED indicators that are helpful. One Amber LED to tell you the unit is connected to your USB, and other green ones by each card slot to let you know either that you have a card insert (solid green), or that it's reading or writing (blinking green).

This card reader comes with a 1 year warranty and I feel it represents a good value. I would recommend it

The Sandisk reader is impossible to misuse. It loads quickly and it's compact shape offers most options for memory. It can be mounted vertically with attached stand for sleek ease of use or compacted flat to be discreet. I would prefer a little more weight so that it doesn't move around on my desk so I'm giving it only 4 stars. If I had to replace this reader, I would buy another SanDisk

I agree that these are not top of the line. But they aren't bad at all. I get coasters occassionally even from top of the line media.

I always burn at half the speed the media is designed for - 2x in this case. It takes longer, but I get good results. I am rarely in a hurry to burn a DVD.

I would buy these again.

** Updated on 7/3/2005 **
I have bought a new computer recently and I have been burning these DVDs with full speed supported by the writer and no coasters what-so-ever. Very happy with this product

I, like many other people that have written reviews here, researched the purchase of an MP3 player in great detail.  Other members of my family own iPods, and that is the direction that I was heading until I did a massive amount of research.  If you want to rip the thousands of songs that you already own on CD, this is the unit that you want.  iPod will not let you download your own songs, I did not know that until after I purchased this player (thankfully).  This unit was the highest rated unit by far that I was able to scour the internet for.  If this is your first purchase of an MP3 player (like mine) buy this one, no questions asked.  Do not worry about trying to buy $80 ear buds the sound from the ear buds that come with the player is unreal.  Crisp, clear, awsome base and I have only turned up the player to 23 on the volume it goes up to 40.  I cannot hear the home stereo that my wife is listening to or my kids that are running around the house playing.  I received this player in the mail today at 5:30 when I got home from work and by 6:35 I have transfered the 114 artists folders (about 4,000+ songs) that I had ripped on my computer last week (about 35 to 40 minutes to transfer the music to the staging folder and then to the player).

I would recomend buying the cradle, it helps in standing it up on the desk or over the stereo, which I plan to do to play all my music on my outdoor speakers by the pool.

Absolutley buy this unit.  I have only messed wit it for a couple of hours and I have a high performance expectation and it has met it

I bought this keyboard originally for the LCD screen and the wide range of possibilities that exist with programming it for various games I play.  I was suprised to learn that this is more than a pretty keyboard with an LCD hanging off of it.  It's the best-feeling keyboard I've ever owned.  The keys take just the right amount of pressure to operate, and the switch to disable the windows key is a welcome feature.  The backlighting is bright, day or night, and the programmable G-keys make executing complicated key combinations in games or business applications a thing of the past.  Highly recommended

I'm very happy with the set.  Although not listed in the specs, it must have a QAM tuner, because I am able to watch unscrambled digital broadcasts through my cable service even though all I have is basic cable.  I was thrilled when I made this discovery.  Watching football games in HD, without paying for digital cable, almost made me weep with happiness.

The picture quality for analog channels is only so-so.  I really wish the remote was illuminated.  Also, Amazon took much longer to deliver the TV than was promised.  Other than these negatives, I'm very happy

We have the original Itrips but wanted this one for travel since it is much eaiser to tune in. The originals work great around town because it is always set on the same station. After reading the instructions I plugged the new Itrip in and it worked perfectly just like the originals. Not only did it work but it worked from 40 feet away. That is better than I expected after reading all the feedback. I'm not sure what everyones problem is. It's not a radio tower, it's a transmitter the size of your finger. I get the feeling that some people think it should power the City block.

I have used the 9510i for about 2 years and have found it to be flawless in performance. The Disaster Recovery software provided with this drive is it's biggest star. You can format your hard drive, put in the restore disk that you create for your system, and in about 15 minutes your system is put back to EXACTLY the way it was when you created the disk. Or you can simply replace selected files if you want. It does not miss a single thing. Fanstastic. The software is extremely user friendly and guides you through the process easier than an &amp;quot;ABC&amp;quot; book. I would highly recommend this drive for performance and ease of use

Ok, I got this as gift so I got nothing to lose right!  Well, this little gadget will be my first open door to the ipod world and i gotta say that it really gives me an awsome impression toward what apple has accomplished for ipod shuffle.
Ever since I unpacked this little thing, it has been with me everywhere!  On the go, exercise, sleeping....anywhere you have pockets to put it, ipod shuffle is always with me whenever I needed some kick of tunes, its ultra light and portability has really achieved what it meant to accomplish in the first place and talking about 1 GB of stores mp3 for about 16 hrs of playtime, it is just too hard not to fall in love with this little part of me...lol!  Sound quality is decent too and it is quite easy to charge and transfer/update tunes on the go.  So if you are a fast paced, mobile and not a control freak, then ipod shuffle is definitely a good way to get giggy with it

If you own a Canon digital camera this printer is great.  It is portable and makes great prints.  People think they are from a photolab.  It is also vey easy to use.  I have seen other mini printers from Olympus and Sony and they are not as good.  They cost more too

I recently purchased this as a replacement for my Monster Cable.  I must say that I am quite impressed.  This is the best FM transmitter I have encountered.

I live in Seattle.  There is a fairly saturated FM dial, and the unique topography of the surrounding area has a tendency to deflect certain signals.  That said, I only have minor problems with interference, the most common of which is moderate distortion in the upper ranges.

Functionality is pretty much seamless in my car.  I drive a 2003 Ford Focus.  The 12v power jack is position to the left of my in dash CD changer, so accessibility is not an issue.

If anyone is in the market for an FM transmitter for their iPod, I highly recommend this one.  "That'll do, pig.  That'll do.

Overall a very nice charger, though recharge times aren't even close to what is advertised.  The display is very nice as is the ability to charge individual batteries instead of having to do it in a pair.  The 900 mAH hold such a small charge that they are almost worthless.

Title: Intuos3 Tablet
Publisher: Wacom
Publish Date: Unknown
ISBN/Model #:  PTZ631W
Reviewer: Robert Saucier
Rating: 5 stars

In 1997, after buying a new top-of-the-line 450MHz Pentium II system, I splurged on a Wacom ArtZ II tablet.  Oh, my!  Pressure-sensitive, tilt-sensing, pointer control, assignable function pads; it was Heaven.

After a couple of years, every time I tried to use it with my primary graphics application, my computer would spontaneously reboot -- a bit counter-productive.  I watched for new drivers and new versions of my application but, as technology marched on, my beloved tablet and graphics application continued their spats.

Sadly, I disconnected the tablet and gently packed it away.  Lately, I've been feeling the pull once more, that urge to use a pen to do photo touch-ups instead of my mouse.  Miraculously, a Wacom Intuos3 6-inch by 11-inch tablet dropped, almost literally, into my lap.  Sleek, gun-metal gray, sexy -- with a comfort-grip pen (much like my coveted Pilot G2 pens) AND a mouse!  Even better, the Intuos3 comes bundled with 3 applications that show off its capabilities:  Adobe Elements 4.0, Corel Painter Essentials 3, and nik Color Efex 2.0 lE.  Heaven just got better!

The Intuos3 has over 5000 lines per inch of resolution, over twice that of the Wacom Graphire product line, and, with its USB 2 connection, there's more than enough communication bandwidth, meaning better tablet to application response.  One hesitation I have when adding a new piece of hardware is in regard to what the driver will do to my system; will it introduce instability or get along with everyone else.  The Intuos3 driver has been rock-solid in the two weeks that the tablet has been living with me.  I've used all of my "usual" programs and have had no problems at all.  The tablet has also been peacefully co-existing with two external drives, a wireless desktop receiver, a card reader, a scanner, and a printer, all riding the same USB bus.

The Intuos3 has 8 "chordable" buttons, 4 at each side of the tablet, to which keys, macros, or other actions may be assigned.  The default for each group are the usual ALT, CTRL/Command, and Shift, along with "space".  The placement of the buttons allows you to keep a grip on the tablet, holding one or more of the buttons, while tapping whatever key on the keyboard with your pen hand.  Being chordable, you can hold any or all of the buttons down for those tricky shortcuts like ALT-CTRL-S or To the side of each of the two button pads are touch strips which can be independently programmed as well.  The default setting is to scroll or depending on the context.  The ends of the strip, in keystroke mode, can be set to playback macros.  The pen, with its 1024-level pressure-sensitive stylus AND "eraser," also has a DuoSwitch.  The DuoSwitch's two positions may also be programmed.

The pen action is smooth with the default nylon nib -- there are different types of nibs to simulate different types of tactile feedback.  With the ergonomic grip, the pen is extremely comfortable to hold.  The 5-button mouse, designed to be used by either "righties" or "lefties," is not as ergonomically correct but considering the versatility, this is more than acceptable.  As with every other clickable/pressable feature associated with the Intuos3, the mouse buttons are programmable with a ridiculous number of options, although I've yet to find the "fix photo,"  "illustrate article," or even the "design website" settings.

I can see only two very minor changes that I would make to this fantastic product.  I would love to see the ability to add weight to the pen.  It is just a bit too light for my personal tastes and considering how configurable the tablet is already, this feature would be the feather on the cap to me.  The other change would be making the drawing surface transparent as it is on the Graphire (and was on the ArtZ II).  Sometimes, having the ability to trace an outline can save significant time.

For the casual home user, I would recommend the Graphire product line -- this Intuos3 model's SRP of $369 may be a bit high where a $99 entry point on the Graphire is more affordable.  For the pro-consumer or professional, however, whether doing photo editing (my primary use) or illustration, the Intuos3 line is well worth the investment.  It's great to be in Heaven again ...

The other effusive reviews are spot-on...  the picture is fabulous on new DVDs (Lord of the Rings, Nemo, Harry Potter).  A $20 Cables to Go HDMI cable does a great job.  We have the  Sony KDF-42E2000 42" 3LCD Rear Projection HDTV and are thrilled with the combination.  A few annoyances:  The machine responds and loads slowly, but that's not too bad; a minor sacrifice for the incredibly low price.  And, certain DVDs of old movies (Some Like it Hot, The King and I) stretch the picture horizontally, making things look squat.  I'm sure there's a solution, but just can't figure it out.  Any tips

I bought this item, since I always make a lot of notes from books and other papers, and don't want to type it in manually anymore. This scanner, probably like any other model, needs a little training to get it right over the paper, but once done, it really works and faster than typing!
I dont use the addressbook or options with your GSM but they are no doubt very handy.
I just scan in from papers, and beam it to my laptop. Both Infrared and the cable work. The cable is especially great for using the scanner 'live'on the screen: the scanned text appears on the pc as you type!
The dictionary also comes in very handy.

It must be a very complex product, but just like the Ipod or ZenXtra mp3 players: they work!
So buy one and save some time! Excellent and recommended for anyone that needs to make notes, or studies, or just wants to stop cutting out pages in newspapers in a train e.g

As your DVD/CD collections grow, these are ideal for protecting and storing your "treasures". Easy to open and take up little storage space. The center lock tab is secure but allows you to remove the discs from the case with ease.
Just a great product

Excellent value -- these batteries are just as good as name brands for about half the price.  If you use a lot of AA's, this is the way to go -- made especially nice if you use them as a filler to get your shipping free on your entire order if it is hovering in the $18 range

I am suprised at the negative reviews on this item since I have considered this one of my smartest buys this year

Just wanted to echo what others have said, that these batteries seem to really last.  I received a new camera and was using generic rechargeable batteries in it, almost as powerful as the 2500s here, and the batteries ran out after a few hours.  Replaced those batteries with these, and these just seem to last on and on.  Am very happy with them

You really can't go wrong with this one.  Not great response but what do you expect for less than $300?  On the other hand, The possibilities for this surround system are endless.  Want something just for the effects to complilment your bedroom wide screen?  How about using it for a dedicated gaming sound system, (this is how my daughter has it configured).  It's our second one.  First one died as a result of recent electrical storm, (Yes the circuit was 'protected', but so what).  Couldn't be happier for the investment

The service from Amazon was great, delivery people were most cooperative, made delivery as promised, placed TV in space where we wanted and hooked up and checked it out.
They even offered to take away the empty carton. We saved about $250 by buying from Amazon rather than from local retailer

If you want a budget home theater system for under $200 there is probably not many systems better then the Sony HT-DDW700. This system is ideal for small rooms such as a bed room or a tiny living room.

Considering the price, sound quality is actually better then expected for me. The tiny cube speakers presents pretty good clarity. They may look like cheap computer speakers but they aren't and are a bit heavier then they look. The center channel may be a little underpowered since dialog during dvd movies sound a tad soft and a little too low. The surround effects during movies in dolby digital and dts are very good though.
If set up properly the speakers handle surround effects very well.

Some minor complaints is that the speaker wire attached to the speakers are very thin. They are fixed and can't be replaced. Also, if you want heart stopping bass then this system might not be for you. The 8" subwoofer is okay considering the price of the system. It is currently better then any other sub included in a home theater system under $200. It isn't powered, is very light (only 9 lbs) and you have to be pretty close to actually feel the bass. The volume would have to be cranked up extremely high for the sub to actually rattle your walls. 

The receiver comes with 1 optical and 1 coxial digital input and 4 rca analog inputs. It should be enough in most cases. An extra digtal input or two wouldn't hurt but again the system is under $200. Setup couldn't be easier. You just hook up the included microphone, place it at your listening postion and press a button on the remote. The system will automatically sets up the speaker distance, delay and volume levels. The receiver comes with the basic pro logic II music and move modes to upmix your stereo sources. It also has other sound fields and effects to enhace the sound but they don't really seem to enhance the sound by that much if at all.

Basically, if you want a home theater system for a small room and for under $200 then there isn't much better then the Sony HT-DDW70

I've owned many Sony electronics in the past and have always liked their styling and functionality -- lots of hardy Walkmen, useful shortwave and portable radios, stylish TVs and high quality cassette recorders.  I still have a Sony mini component stereo model FH-E656 (made in Japan) which I bought in 1992 for US$400+; but rather than pay to fix its worn-out CD player, I decided to purchase this new Sony MHCEC70 component stereo (made in China).

PLUSES: 
decent sound
good functionality
easy set-up and intuitive operation
simple remote -- but only covers basic functions

CONS:
very short speaker leads
unattractive styling (for my tastes) -- resembles a boombox
only holds 3 CDs vs 5 for comparable Panasonic units

At first glance, I was disappointed by the cheap construction, skimpy manual and very short speaker leads -- the manufacturer seemed to be counting pennies.  But then I thought: in 2006 for $150, I can't expect the same quality as I received in 1992 for $400.  Everything is made more cheaply now and almost all in China.  So, for the money, it suits my purposes as a nice sounding stereo unit for the bedroom.  The real test will be how long the CD changer works -- to be safe, this time I bought the 2 year replacement warranty.  I haven't blasted it at full volume, but it seems to have plenty of power when needed.

I originally bought a $300 Panasonic unit (SC-PM71SD MP3 SD Micro System) which was returned because it didn't have the full data recording feature as advertised (data recording was crippled by DRM limitations).  This Sony stereo costs half as much, and has almost all the same functionality

After looking around at the local stores (Fry's and CompUSA) I had just about given up on finding a single case that would offer reasonable protection for my iPod in multiple environments - on my belt and also in exercise, and had resigned myself to having a "skin" type case for just everyday use and then shifting the iPod to an arm band for exercise. Not a particularly great solution - expensive (around $20 for each) and a lot of shifting back and forth to cover both uses.

Then I ran into the DLO Action Jacket at Best Buy, which seemed to cover all my intended uses. Unlike the prior reviewer, I found my 40g iPod fits VERY snugly - absolutely zero slop, and I really like not having to worry about keeping up with more than one case. Also, at $29.95, it's cheaper than the two-case approach. The only criticism I have of this jacket is that when you want to convert from belt clip to sport use you have to snake the band through two loops on the backside of the case and over the little plastic belt clip receiver that protrudes from the back of the case. The process is a little tedious, but the end result is great. The unit feels very secure on my arm and it's easy to forget that it's there.

This jacket is a winner

We've had this printer for almost two years. I do a good amount of printing, both color &amp; b/w. While I do need to do cleanings more often with this printer, mine is not sucking up ink at an unreasonable rate at all. And it is very affordable. Photos don't always print well... the only photo paper I have found to work well with my S530D was very the glossy trial pack that came with it when I bought it. No other photo paper has done well at all, so I suggest theirs. This is the best printer we have had in 10 years, and belive me I've thrown my share out the window! I can offer THIS advice to owners of ANY printers. Always use the power switch ON THE PRINTER to turn it on off, never use the power strip switch, or the switch from properties. For some reason doing so supposedly wastes ink? I don't get it, but I've always followed that advice and this printer has been an absolute gem for us. Good Luck! Jeanni

I,ve seen complaints about the ac adapter you "must" plug in. Hey guys, try it without an outside energy source, I just hope I,m not gonna fry something but it seems to work fine just plugged into a powered USB port. I have a VERY high end system though with wattage to sprare, but no more PCI slots, Damn 7900 512 gtx graphics cards, why do 2 of em have to take up so much room. Oh well, trade offs are a bi---, but a reality and 7 extra USB slots are awfully nice

The DPI adjustment is a nice touch.  I prefer corded mice due to cordless being to heavy, this mouse is just right

I have two seperate units.  One hardwired to my car, and the other is the JVC unit.  I hooked it directly into the audio (aux) ports of my Radio, rather than use an fm station.  It works great, the sound quality is excellent as well - (and my radio is so old it play's 8-tracks!!!!).  I did notice that the unit tends to run a bit warm to hot.  I agree with the previous reviews, that it is something that JVC needs to look into, perhaps it is simply a matter of a "heat sink-er" not being in specs, as yet, I have encountered no problems (having had the JVC unit for 1.5 years)  No matter.  As to the commercial free: Sirius (which I have had a subscription to for the past 4 years) has commercial free radio, though the news stations and a few others do have commercials.  Those stations are clearly defined as being in the commercial block.  The music stations are 100% free of commercial. 

All in all a damn cheap price to pay for avoidance of all those really irritating DJ's, commerical's, and lack of variety in stations!  ~Cheers!

I was about to retire an old standalone DVD recorder, because it would no longer let me create menus or finalize discs.  I bought this lens cleaner and -- voila! -- the recorder is working again.  Super easy to use (it's simply a DVD that you insert into your machine, and the menus tell you what to do).  Highly recommended

Quick reader, poor design. It does a great job copying images to my Mac, but the flimsy lid is a piece of poo-poo. It stays on tight, which is good, until you try to open it. The force required to open it pulls the lid completely off making the ball-groove hinges useless. It's only a matter of time until the weak arms containing the hinges snap off, leaving the reader exposed to the elements

I purchased the Adorama Slinger Bag after first purchasing the Tamrac Velocity 5.  The Tamrac bag is a nice bag and can be worn as either a shoulder bag or a waist bag. Unfotunately, it lacked sufficient support when worn as waist bag and did not have an attached pouch to carry a water bottle.  The Slinger Bag addressed both of these deficiencies.  When worn as a waist bag, it also uses the shoulder strap to keep the bag firmly in place which also helps to balance the weight of the bag.  There are two water pouches on the Slinger Bag (which is a real requirement as I live in Arizona).

The Adorama Slinger Bag is a great travel bag. It is light weight and has great utility.  I highly recommend it.

I've never had any problems with Memorex DVD's or CD's. When I was ordering and read some of the reviews here, I had to go back and look at what I was using to make sure. I've always taken it for granted and only posted this review to counteract some of the negative ones. I don't know why some users are having problems, but these DVD's always worked great for me, and I record on average over one a day

I agree that this drive can be a little slow, but it hasn't caused a problem for me. I keep copies of many files (about 1 GB total) related to a large project at work on mine. When I first copied all the files to the drive it took a couple of minutes, but now I just make changes or updates to the individual files and the write times are short enough that I don't even notice them (just a second or two). I also seemlessly work on the files on both a PC at work and a Mac at home. 

To me the best feature is the reliability. Between my husband and I, we've had several Cruzer Minis in various sizes and each one has worked great, even through accidental abuse. One of his 512 MB drives accidently went through the washing machine. We thought the data was gone, but when it dried out, it worked fine. Just today I found my 2 GB drive at the bottom of the dryer; it had been left in a pocket and had gone through both the washing machine and dryer. Yep, it still worked! I'm buying a new one to replace it (just in case) because I don't know it there might be some long-term effects from the water and heat, but I'll keep using this one for less important applications. Changes are good, though, that it'll never have a problem. These things are amazingly reliable

I bought these as a gift for my husband to watch TV late at night without disturbing me.  He loves them.  The sound is fine and the headphones are comfortable.

The Nike+ system has really been a good motivator for me. As a new runner, I need all the motivation and positive reinforcement I can get. The challenges and goals are a good way to keep on track as well.

I didn't buy the Nike+ shoes - I use mine with the Marware Sportsuit Relay set up. It's a great system and a lot cheaper than spending $100 for a pair of running shoes when I already have a couple good pairs in the closet. 

Both products are highly recommended

I've had this card for about 1 1/2 years now and it has performed flawlessly. It has seen thousands of photos (no exaggeration!) on my digital camera and now holds data/mp3s for my palm too. Did you know you can pop your SD card out of a camera and into a palm to view photos? I just learned this. Anyway it's a nice product and I'm about to get another SimpleTech with 512 megs or higher if they have one. If you are new to SD memory, always get more storage than you need because eventually you'll buy something that will use one (camera, handhelds, cell phones, etc. -- note that many cell phones use a smaller "MiniSD")

This is a perfect mp3 player. I had the 40Gb model before this and needed a bit of extra room. You can't ask for anything more than this. It does everything an mp3 player should, and more (podcasts, videos, photos). I bought the 60 a couple of weeks before the 80 was released at the same price. Bad timing on my behalf..

This review pertains specifically to the Targus PAUH217U 4 Port Ultra Mini USB 2.0 Hub. 
The cord is about 2.5 feet long - long enough to reach from my pc, which sits on the ground, to the top of the desk. It has a cable which is split into two USB plugs - one just to transmit data, the second to power the unit. The second plug does not need to be used unless you plan on using some heavy-duty hardware, and if so what are you buying a hub called the ultra mini for anyways? If you insist on trying to run a blow dryer off the thing, then it does have an input for a separate power source, which you will have to buy separately. 

In short, If you have an old school machine with USB ports which are inaccessible /inconvenient to use, this little hub will give you quick access while taking up minimal space on your desk

I bought this card about 10 months ago to go with my Nikon D70 and I've certainly had no regrets. I haven't tried pushing the card to its limits to see how quickly it can write, but it's been plenty fast enough to keep up with me in single-shot mode. The card is always ready when I am. Downloading from the card to computer via my SanDisk Imagemate is fast too.

I like it so much, I'm buying a second one today

I bought this system recently after my Panasonic DVD Surround System broke. I was a little leary about this system since other reviewers have mentioned a hissing noise here on Amazon and other sites for that matter. But I couldn't find anything like this value and decided I could just take it back if I didn't like it. Well, I love it! The sound is great! Subwoofer is awesome! I do not hear a hissing noise at all. This sounds so much better than my Panasonic which broke and that I had paid $100 more for

I have been looking for an easier way to protect the front my my lens without having to either take off my lens hood or trying to fumble around with the lens cap with the hood still on.  Op/Tech came up with the solution!  All you have to do is stretch the proper size hood hat over the hood and everything is protected and ready to go.  Super easy to take off, putting on takes a little more time, but you never miss a picture putting it on anyway.  Basically this is an inexpensive way to add some extra insurance against getting dirt, water, etc on your front element while you are walking around looking for shots.  It is also very flexible and easy to stick in a pouch or pocket when not being used

 I had owned an LG burner and from the time I got it, it never worked right. I must have made 60 or 70 coasters before I decided that it was'nt the media, it was the crappy LG brand burner. I was really afraid because there are so many burners on the market and all of them claim to be good, but as I found out with my LG experience, that is not always true. 
 My brother has an older model Sony burner and although his is slow, it has made a handful of coasters in the 5 years that he has owned it, so I took a chance and purchased the Sony DRU-810A. That was the best decision I could have made. I will never buy another brand burner other that Sony brand. I have had this burner about 7 or 8 months. I am a very heavy burner and I have not made one coaster. 
 One thing I loved about my brother's Sony burner is that I could use any brand of media. The same thing is true of the DRU-810A. I don't have to worry about where the media was manufactured or who the maker is. This burner loves everything. I had looked at the Plextor brand, but I did'nt want to pay $100.00 and I looked at NEC brand, LiteOn, BenQ. etc., but I am so happy that I passed on them all and got the Sony. It burns super fast. Some people say that it is loud, but it's not loud to me.
 I got my burner from Tiger Direct for $50.00. My sister's computer came with a crappy LG brand burner too and for almost 2 years she has not been able to burn at all because she gets nothing but coasters too, so for Christmas I am buying her a Sony DUR-810A so she can finally burn some movies. For my money, this is the best burner bar none.

I bought it for my Canon S3 IS. First I tried it without formatting and fill it up with photos and video and no problems. Then I did the suggested format by Canon and it worked the same: perfect. Fast enough to cope with the demands of the camera; haven't any problem of corruption. 

I've been tempted to buy another one.

I read the other reviews on this bookholder and wasn't so sure about it.  However, after buying and trying it out, I have no regrets.  Don't know why I waited soo long to get one (dont be like me and wait until you start to feel some neck strain from hours of studying hunched over before buying one).  Although made of plastic, it is very study and has nice rubber feet to keep it from sliding.  The clips on the bottom work very well to keep pages open and you can change how firm or loose you want it to hold.  Unlike other models, this one folds completely flat so you can carry it in your backpack between books.  I have used it mostly for softcover textbooks and have no problem

Look, for a bargain-basement product, what do you expect?  First, you expect it to work, and I can confirm it definitely does work.

When plugged in to USB, it signals XP correctly.  The driver software is very tolerant.  You can install it at any time and there is never a resource conflict or problems with the system recognizing the device.  So installation is a 5 minute process.

Next comes the capture and initial encoding.  Well, the software is a bit lame as far as features and GUI.  Typical.  But it absolutely saves in MPEG2 / DVD format just as you'd need it to for making DVDs of all your Dish Network or PS2 or VHS content.  

The frame rate is full on 30 fps.  It takes an SVIDEO or standard RCA video signal.  Both are just fine in quality.  The resolutions are not that great... but its passable for DVD when you crank it up.  Don't think you can encode some Blu-Ray quality MPEG with this though.

As far as the overall durability of the product, I've literally left mine plugged into the wall and running for about 1 year straight.  It gets hot, but its never so much as flickered or needed reset.  

Bottom line?  This thing is like a kids toy- its cheesy but tough as nails.  Get it for your first analog signal MPEG encoder.  Its a good value.

I purchased the 2GB Elite Pro SD card but found out that my older SimpleTech FlashLink card reader is not able to recognize the card under WinXP SP2 with and without the most recent SimpleTech drivers. I don't have another card reader for my computer, but the pictures recorded on it by my digital camera can be viewed on my PDA so I assume that it's the card reader. Shortly afterwards, I also discovered that Kingston makes a combo kit that includes their USB 2.0 SD/MMC reader for a bit less in price than the card alone.

I also noticed the ATP line of 60x and 150x SD cards. I have no experience with their products, but their SD cards are potted versus placed in a plastic shell. They tout their cards as being more rugged and waterproof. I'm very careful and have not had any flash cards fail on me, but with the rising capacities and smaller form factors, I will consider the ATP cards in the future.

I'm very careful and have not had any flash cards fail on me, but with the rising capacities and smaller form factors, I will consider the ATP cards in the future.

Works like a charm, the Wi-Fi sniffer in the software is definitely a big plus ! You can get details of the connection i.e. connection strength, AP name and etc. Worth every penny

The initial flash card that came with my camera was far too short to save pictures.  When I went surfing for another flash card with some depth, Amazon really came through for me and the price was excellent.

My DVD player was ready to be thrown out, until I saw this product on amazon.  My DVD player wouldn't even load a DVD.  It kept saying "please check disc". After loading this disc, my DVD player has worked perfectly ever since.  Don't spent $30 on one of these "clean up discs". This one does the job

Overall this is a very good remote.  It replaced 5 of my remotes, which is all except my Bose, which is RF controlled.  It even replaced my Windows Media Center Edition remote and works with my PS2 with no problems.
My negatives for this device are that the layout is a little less comfortable and intuitive than some of my other remotes and the default functions aren't necessarily the most used functions therefore requiring additional time to set-up.  These negative however are more than acceptable when you remember that it works with so many devices.  I am definitely happy with this remote and would undoubtably purchase again

After doing a fair amount of Internet research about MP3 players and their features I was under the impression that I would go with an iPod.  Having been in the computer industry for almost 15 years I have never been fond of the Mac and have always been a little biased towards PC's.  This added to my reticence to own a Mac product and the growing complaints about service on the iPod being a 'bit' over priced I forged on.

I started reading through all of the reviews I could find on the Internet and as always, found a wealth of them here on Amazon.  To my dismay all the reviews I could find on product names I knew absolutely trashed the products they were reviewing which scared me immensely.  Thats is, until I got to the iAudio line.  The reviews were almost all positive and the complaints that were present were things I could easily overlook.  I love the control, I am big guy with big hands and I have rarely, if ever, pushed the control and not had the result I was intending.

I have had my iAudio X5 for over a month and I have nothing bad to say in the least.  I am an avid Linux user and it works flawlessly with Linux, the sound quality is phenomenal, except the ear buds that came with mine have a lot of static in them so get rid of those.  The FM tuner is great (you wont get that on an iPod).  I travel a lot and I pipe my X5 through my car stereo using a cassette tape converter plugged into the stereo out port.

What else can I say, this is a great product with great features and it looks good too!  I also bought a case from zCover which fits the purpose but I think that as time goes on some better more versatile cases will come to market.

A Satisfied Custome

I bought this keyboard originally for the LCD screen and the wide range of possibilities that exist with programming it for various games I play.  I was suprised to learn that this is more than a pretty keyboard with an LCD hanging off of it.  It's the best-feeling keyboard I've ever owned.  The keys take just the right amount of pressure to operate, and the switch to disable the windows key is a welcome feature.  The backlighting is bright, day or night, and the programmable G-keys make executing complicated key combinations in games or business applications a thing of the past.  Highly recommended

This is a great piece of hardware, the wireless rear speakers was a big selling point for me. But in my apartment I would like to have more control over the subwoofer speaker, it's volume slider is hidden in a settings menu there is no separate knob for it on the speaker itself. The bass sound from subwooferis overbearing at default. The other thing is that I would like to be able to have better control over the sound itself with an equalizer. That's not going to happen with this system, you can't change that easily. And yes the 5 disk changer is slow. The maximum volume setting doesn't seem that loud to me, but then I have the decibal settings at default. All the sound quality you expect from a theater system is here, it has all the flavors. Hooking it up to an xbox directly didnt work the way I'd like it too, but I only tried RCA and not the digital. I have a sony 32" Wega and I had the xbox patch to it and then routed to the DAV-FX100 reciever. That works like a charm, even with 5.1 sound from XBOX. One huge complaint I have is the shielding for the mid and left and right front speakers are not the best. I see a bit of haze from the magnetic fields from both the front 3 speakers, even had to elevate my center channel for fear that would permanently damage the tube on my TV. There is mention of this problem in the manual but that should be on the front page not the middle of the manual! Beware! Four Stars

You will appreciate this product only if you don't have enough USB ports. In my case, I had plenty of ports, but needed an extension cable, which would help me in plugging the flash drives, whithout bending down and plunging into the cave of wires(I keep my CPU, under the table).The only complaint I have is the the wire lenght is not long enough.
Overall good value for price

First, I would buy it again if I needed to.  This 15" takes up less space on the kitchen counter, i.e., speakers are on the bottom. Second, picture and sound are excellent, i.e, clear.
I would not buy this item if I wanted a true VESA mount to monitor configuration.  The stand, not the monitor, has the screw holes for the VESA wall mount.  Not enough or clear info in the description. However, it is just as easy to turn on the counter as on the wall.  If you need counter space then buy something else.

I bought the intuos 6x11 pen tablet couple weeks ago and I use it
almost every day so far so good, I don't expect to have any problems with it.
I used to have a small wacom graphire and I used for years then unfortunately the pen broke so now I own a new one 
the only advice I can give to you is to keep it clean, wipe it out every now and then with a wet cloth

Alot Better Then Wrapping The Neck Strap Around Your Arm Or Hand...
It Really Depends On What Kind Of Photography You Do. I Shoot At Night Clubs And Weight Can Add Up. I Have A Canon Rebel XT, Hand Grip With 2 Batties, Canon 550EX Flash, And 50mm F/1.4 Or 17-40mm F/2.8
It Feels Alot Better Using The Hand Strap...

I recently purchased this item for my wife who has a small office.  the reception on this unit is great.  Bieng in a steel building she is able to get all the local radio stations. The sound quality on it is perfect for a small room considering the price range it is in.  If you are looking for a booming sound this is not for you but it will provide a solid quality sound.

This is an awesome tablet! It has great pressure sensitivity and the pen allows for fantastic freehand drawing in programs like illustrator, photoshop and painter. The pen is a more natural feeling tool to use in these applications than a mouse. The size of the tablet allows you to get into greater detail without having to zoom in all the time.

I bought a 1GB with my new camera because I was giving my other camera and it's 256 memory card to my sister.  The smaller card would fill quickly and I'd have to develope the pictures or deleat them.  I paid about $9.00 more for my card in Sept., and thought that was a deal.  Now, you can get this card for $20.00.  That's a steal for a 1 GB.  also, I like the little case provided to keep the card safe when I take it to the store to develope the pictures.  Love it

I've been using these earbuds for several months now, and they're far better than the ones that come with the iPod. They're more comfortable, and there's so much more bass, although as everyone else pointed out you have to push them way into your ears to get the bass.

My pair has gone through the washing machine twice and the dryer once, and they still sound just as good as the day I got them! (I did have to glue one of the earpieces back together, though.) I thought I'd certainly destroy them by getting them wet, but these things are industrial strength

You may as well pitch the instructions because they're worthless (and the only reason I'm not giving a 5-star rating for the ADS Tech Video Xpress).  I was about ready to pitch the product as well, after losing two evenings trying to figure out how to get it to work.  Ultimately, I gave up on relying solely on the program it came with, and I instead opted to try it on my Windows Movie Maker.  Yahoo!  Perseverance paid off!  Once I switched to Movie Maker, this tool worked great!  

To date, I've converted about a dozen videos of content to computer files that I was able to burn to DVDs.  I just leave my Xpress hooked up to the back of my television so I don't have to try to remember later how to hook it up again.  Doing that, I can connect my laptop to the Xpress and start the video converting process within 3-4 minutes.  My Movie Maker program takes over the entire process.  

The ADS Tech Video Xpress has been especially useful for me because I teach a college telecourse and often show edited video clips to my students.  Before purchasing Xpress, I had crudely edited videos that I was reluctant to use; my videos had lots of amateur stop/start points.  Using Movie Maker with Xpress, I was able to download these videos to my laptop, then easily edit them so transitions between stop and start points became smooth and seamless.  

Pretty cool.  I'm glad I took a chance on this product!

Below are hook-up and program instructions I've written to myself for easy reference later.  Hopefully they'll be of more help to you than the instructions that come with this product:

First, hook up the Video Xpress equipment as follows:
1.  S-cable (buy one, since it doesn't come with the VideoXpress) goes from the back of your television to the VideoXpress.  
2.  Use red/white/yellow cords running into the back of the VCR/DVD that is hooked up to your televion as follows:
- all three plug into the "video out" column
- all three plug into the VideoXpress tool at the other end.  
3.  The USB plug for the VideoXpress tool plugs into the back of the computer.

Next, open the Instant Video Xpress program and verify the settings are as follows:
- "NTSC M" for the video standard setting
- "640 x 480" and "60 FPS (VGA)" for video format
- "DVD, VCR, TV" for video source
- "Video composite" for video input

Under the program advanced settings:
- Low motion (TV, VCD, DVD)
- CPU support: "SSE3"
- Stereo system: "MTS"
- Video decoder: "video standard: NTSC_M"

Under properties within the program advanced settings:
- Stream format:  Video format: "NTSC_M"
- Frame rate: "59.940"
- Color space/compression: "YUY2"
- Outputs size: "640x480"

Finally, CLOSE the Instant Video Xpress program.  (Windows Movie Maker can't access the video until this program is closed.  And yes, it's silly to have to open it, make those setting changes, then close it, but Video Xpress won't work correctly unless you follow those setting steps.)

In case you need this information for Windows Movie Maker, the steps (in order) are as follows:
Under "File," click on "capture video."

Use the following settings:
- audio device set at: "USB2.0 Analog Audio Device"
- Video input source set at: "Composite"
Under Configure Video Capture Device:
- Video format: Video standard: "NTSC_M"
		   Frame rate: "29.970"
		   Color space/compression: "YUY2"
		   Output size: "640x480"

Under Camera settings:
- Deinterlace method: "Low motion (TV, VCD, DVD)"
- CPU support: "SSE3"
- Stereosystem: "MTS"

Under Video decoder: Video standard: "MTSC_M"
Signal detected: "1"
Lines detected: "525"
Then...

Give the file a name and indicate where to save it

Set it for "best quality" for playback.

Then "Start Capture."

If the Video Xpress is hooked up and running correctly, you should see on your computer monitor the video image of whatever is showing on television, but you will NOT hear the sound.  When you finish capturing and play it back, THEN you'll hear the sound.

I know, I know -- clear as mud.  But hey, it's better than the Xpress instructions!  :-

I have been using Memorex dvd-r blank media for more than a year and have gotten fine recordings with my new dvd player/recorder.  Not all of my recordings were successful, no product I know is 100% perfect, but the majority have been successful with Memorex dvd blank media.
This 50-pack spindle was purchased from Amazon because I know I can rely on them to give you the best in quality and value plus free shipping.   Moreover, I have never really been disappointed with anything purchased from Amazon.   
After trying many dvd-r blank media, I found Memorex dvd-r spindles to be affordable and reliable for a better than average performance.

Not quite as powerful as I was hoping for, but the sound is alright and in a small room it'll do fine.

Careful, there is no plug-in at the back, so you can only connect MP3 or auxiliary stuff through the little front jack.

Otherwise it's easy to use and pretty cool-looking... ideal for quiet listening, lame if you host a big party and need loud stuff

The pro and cons described by other reviews are valid. I was specifically looking for a boombox that has cassette, mp3, cd and radio capability. So didn't have much of an option but to get this one. I am impressed with the sound quality but agree that there could have been improvements related to interface and some of the functionality. Overall I think its a good buy.

I LOVE this arm band. I have had it for about 6 months now. You dont have to take your iPOD out of the arm band to charge it or to hook it up to your computer. I also only use my iPOD for the gym, so its nice that this arm band provides great protection (better than iPOD's armbands because it fits snugly and wont scratch it when you put it on) as well as not coming off while working out.

I bought the 128MB card 8-9 mnths ago. At first didnt notice it but the usable memory kept getting smaller! Finally it gave a 'Error Reading Card'  message and stopped working. Customer service at Viking was very very helpful and prompt. They replaced the card is 7 days. They also tried to retrieve some of the images that I had considered 'lost' in the card and sent me a CD with the images on it! I was impressed with the excellent support, but not too impressed that the card died so early in its life. Would I buy it again? Yes but likely go for keeping a backup card on hand at all times as well

<review_text>
(Note to Brian: The WAP54G *can* be configured as a bridge. I have two of them in just such a configuration. Took me about 10 minutes to set them up.)

Major modes of operation are:

1. Wireless Access Point (its default set-up)
2. Wireless Client (connect a wired ethernet device via cable to the WAP54G and you now have a wireless ethernet device)
3. Wireless Repeater (extend range of wireless coverage)
4. Wireless Bridge (connect two ethernet networks without running a cable between them -- acts as one end of a "virtual" cable; you need two to get the job done)

A pair of wireless bridges is just what I needed but hesitated to buy the WAP54G because of Brian's comment that this wouldn't work. Because of my newness to the wireless world it took a bit of investigation to come to the conclusion that Brian was wrong. I bought a pair and they do work.

I rate it 4 instead of 5 stars for a few reasons.

1. I understand that higher-end, more expensive, equipment can be had with more range than this box. Gotta leave some room to rate more powerful equipment!
2. One must dig very deeply into the users guide (a PDF on the CD) to find the default IP address in order to configure this device. Luckily I had read elsewhere what that IP address is (192.168.1.245). Other manufacturers make this info readily available, even going so far as printing it on the device itself. This will be critical info to any Linux user. Also, the users guide says that the default userid for logging in is "admin". Well, it's not. The only allowed userid is an empty field. This had me going for a few minutes.
3. Something that 99% of the world won't care about -- I like to have more access to the firmware. For example other Linksys products allow one to telnet to the box and do low-level analysis of the box and the network it's attached to. I think there are third-party firmware loads that enable this

This card is the 2 GB Ultimate 120X  It has a tested write speed 120 times 150kb/sec which exceeds 18 mb per second.  Frequently card manufacturers advertise their read speed, which is always much faster. Analyze your file size for pictures you take and the speed in mb/sec will tell you how many of those pictures you can store in one second.

That impacts time between pictures. For cameras, write speed is the most important, but the speed rating of the card doesn't necessarily tell you its write speed.  For music players and other devices, read speed may be more important.  So you might choose a different card depending on whether you intend to use it to play music or take pictures.  I'm currently shopping for SD cards for a camera with the capability to shoot 3 pictures per second with large file sizes.  In order not to slow the camera down, I need a fast card.  I have done some research and realized that the reviews here aren't necessarily even related to this particular card, but are for all different sizes and speeds of Kingston cards. Kingston has been in the memory business for a long time and they are conservative in their ratings.  This card is #1 on my list right now because of its tested write speed

I bought this memory card for my camera sd500.  At first, I was very dispointed when I only see 1gb on my laptop.  After googled around, I realized I need to update my laptop sd reader driver to recognized sd card that is over 1gb.  I'm able to see full 2gb after driver update.  Just make sure you update your device/laptop firmware/driver first

I first saw these speakers at the Apple store, and i really liked the sound and the look.  I went on amazon and found a better price and i couldnt be happier with them.  As long as you have a decent soundcard, these speakers really are great.  i have had no problem with them at all, they look really cool, they're loud, they're small, the woofer gives you a lot of bass (which you can turn down), and the sound from the speakers is clear.  buy these

It's speedy and space saving and inexpensive. I bought this to replace my Belkin because the Belkin needed to be plugged in. This one is powered by your computer so there's no extra power cords, which is a big plus to me. 

The only thing I dislike about this is the fact that the Hub takes up two Usb ports instead of just one like the Belkin.

You will appreciate this product only if you don't have enough USB ports. In my case, I had plenty of ports, but needed an extension cable, which would help me in plugging the flash drives, whithout bending down and plunging into the cave of wires(I keep my CPU, under the table).The only complaint I have is the the wire lenght is not long enough.
Overall good value for price

I wanted a non-iPod digital music player, and found this to be a terrific option.  It plays a number of different formats, and includes a lanyard, which is nice when commuting on the train, or for plane travel.  I have only used alkaline batteries so far, and have had excellent battery life.  The menu takes an hour or 2 of playing with to learn, but once you get familiar with the buttons and menu, it's pretty easy.  I have also enjoyed the built in FM tuner, and have not any trouble with reception, even on a moving commuter train.  The sound quality is very good.  I've been using 128 bitrate MP3 songs so far.  The software for transferring music is pretty easy to use, although I did have a little trouble getting the player to be recognized as connected, which seemed to be some kind of order of connections issue.  The included earbuds aren't the most comfortable, especially since I already lost the foam padding, but I will probably get a better pair anyway.  They do sound good though.  Also, the included cases are pretty cheesy and I didn't even bother with them.

A little hint:  One thing I did not like was that because of the location of the on button, the unit can fairly easily be turned on when you have it stored in a bag or pocket.  To combat this, simply turn the Hold on.  The unit won't turn on accidentally when it's on

I,ve seen complaints about the ac adapter you "must" plug in. Hey guys, try it without an outside energy source, I just hope I,m not gonna fry something but it seems to work fine just plugged into a powered USB port. I have a VERY high end system though with wattage to sprare, but no more PCI slots, Damn 7900 512 gtx graphics cards, why do 2 of em have to take up so much room. Oh well, trade offs are a bi---, but a reality and 7 extra USB slots are awfully nice

I was about to retire an old standalone DVD recorder, because it would no longer let me create menus or finalize discs.  I bought this lens cleaner and -- voila! -- the recorder is working again.  Super easy to use (it's simply a DVD that you insert into your machine, and the menus tell you what to do).  Highly recommended

Just a note to those who've been having trouble opening these cases, without breaking them. If you use an emory board to slightly sand the top knob which is holding the case together, you'll be able to open and close it ok. Don't sand too much, and just do the top knob, or it won't hold together. I like the fact that these cases are clear and fairly inexpensive, so I wanted to make them work. Hope it works for you

I do all my burning on a standard Windows Media player, and it's almost entirely data and music, no video. For my purposes, these CD's sound great. In some cases, it actually seems like the discs have enhanced the sound spectrum somewhat. That may be a trick my ears are playing on me but, nevertheless, I'm a big fan of the Memorex. And they're a steal if you catch the sale price. Recommended

When I buy flash memory, I consider price, speed, manufacturer and vendor. I got this particular memory stick for a SonyEricsson w810i phone. I paid extra to get it from Amazon (no they don't always have the best price). This way I am confident that I can return it if I got the wrong one or have a problem with it.

The card works fine in my phone, and since I have a USB cable that hooks up to the phone, I don't have to be concerned about removing the card to use a card reader. I have not yet experienced any problems with Sandisk memory products.

I am told that the Sandisk sticks are faster than Sony's, but I have no way to confirm this, nor do I know if my phone (mp3 player, camera) is able to take advantage of faster speeds. The longest process is transferring music to the phone, and I wasn't in a hurry anyway.

This stick comes with an adapter to use with the older memory stick format, so I can use the 128mb stick that I replaced in my Sony Camcorder (which had a 4mb stick in it. No, it's not a typo. It's actually a 4 megabyte memory stick)

Just my two cents, I bought these from the sony store for $15 bucks two years ago, they've lasted me this long for light office use, so at $7/year, this seems to be a good budget earphones.  I'm not an audiophile, so I don't need expensive earphones.  However they did eventually die on me where the cable connects to the jack, the wires got loose and the sound just stopped.  Moral of the story: don't twist or touch the wires/cable.

Pros:  lightweight, budget-oriented, comfortable fit for my ears
Cons:  eventually broke, cheap earphone covers will get lost easil

If you snap shots in burst mode, or if you want to take pictures at sporting events, fast cards like those are the way to go.
Almost no lag, large capacity, lifetime warranty, no complaints

I purchased several of these cards .... they work great and as advertised. The D200 has a memory buffer ... but these are still FAST cards!  I have used them in the D70 as well.

Sandisk, leader in this kind of technology products sure do not come short with this one. It works excellent on my phone Samsung t609.I would have bought a 1GB but the phone manufacturer do not recomend it, so bear that in mind. For pictures the resolution at close range and bright light is just excellent. For music as an MP3, lots of memory and room to fill as well as for video. Data and in general is terrific...just like I said Sandisk leads the competition and also seems to be the the standard card for just about any product that requires this kind of card. I will most definitely and undoubtely will not accept substitutions. Only Sandisk is extremely reliable. Personal experiences with these products proof it repeatledly.

For the Price, I doubt you could do better.  True, there are higer-end devices out there that will improve your picture to the pinnacle of performance, but if all you're after is a significant improvement in the quality of EVERY channel and DVD you watch, you can't beat the ADS for it's price. The biggest flaw is the device's inability to deal with program material that has excessive light or white backgrounds, where the device either creates artifacts or attempts to correct resolution causing my Philips Plasma set to black-out for moments.  This aside, I'm very happy with the ADS, especially it's under $300 price.  One day maybe I'll upgrade to a unit by DVDO, but not until they come don to the sub-$500 range

The one in our bedroom wouldn't always work, couldn't hear the kids calling.  I was unplugging my laptop charger at the same time someone was calling and discovered the charger was filtering the voice.  Both my Dell charger and Thinkpad charger had the same effect, even without the laptop plugged into the charger.  If your having problems, I would start with unplugging other things first.

Overall, these have been a Godsend, wife no longer has to scream at the kids across the entire house.  Used to drive me crazy

I used to buy Energizers and Duracells at $3-4 a pop for four batteries.  Now I buy generic Alkalines at Costco.  Cost: $8 for 10 four packs.  It's like having a battery store in the kitchen drawer.  According to a recent coprehensive story in Consumer Reports, there is only a little difference between name brand and generic alkaline batteries

You will appreciate this product only if you don't have enough USB ports. In my case, I had plenty of ports, but needed an extension cable, which would help me in plugging the flash drives, whithout bending down and plunging into the cave of wires(I keep my CPU, under the table).The only complaint I have is the the wire lenght is not long enough.
Overall good value for price

I bought this model in order to be rid of my almost-new Sony MHCEC70 with its faulty ergonomics and detestable tuner.  Having once owned an earlier PM-series model, this new Panasonic was the obvious choice and it does not disappoint.  Like its predecessor, the PM53 is a nice, powerful compact stereo with (for the money) ridiculously nice audio quality and a good tuner, especially on the FM band.  It can easily be turned up load enough to cause hearing damage and annoy neighbors in adjacent houses.  The remote covers every function and is easy enough to figure out without consulting the manual.  

Right now, this is the budget stereo of choice for the discerning.  Sony's competing models are cheesy-looking (hog attention on store shelves,) bigger (i.e., take more materials/cost more to ship,) and consequently suffer certain cost-cutting measures like the aforementioned crappy tuner and simplified (and of course, proprietary) antenna connector.  It's like choosing between the Pontiac and the Toyota.  The Sony is for the unwashed rubes who want 300 watts of mylar-coated bling.  The Panasonic is for people who want something that makes pleasant sounds and looks like the rest of the furniture.

I read some of the reviews about installation issues and they concerned me initially. But, when it came time to get the printer up and running on my wireless network, there really weren't any issues. Just following the directions (and avoiding the EasySecure option) worked fine. I would highly recommend this printer-the quality of the printing is excellent, the feature/function set is quite high for a moderate price, and it's a great home/office printer that has lots to offer.

I bought this because I did not want to mount my Garmin 350 Nuvi to the windshield. This device makes is much easier to switch the unit to different cars. I drove normally and the unit did not slide around on my dashboard. I can also mount the unit on a center console and it works there too. Please note that this is a complete unit for portable mounting and it is much cheaper than buying the sandbag &amp; mounting arm separately

I have had my Handspring Visor Deluxe for 5...yes, FIVE years (actually longer).  While I take decent care of it, it has taken care of me.  My doctor has one too...exactly like mine and we often talk about how perhaps they should be replaced, but the darn thing is still working great and does everything we need it to.  I finally ordered a new PDA with all the capabilities of my laptop and am passing this one on to someone else who needs it. (I'm not selling it...good karma)  

Down to business - the Handspring Visor Deluxe is not the creme de la creme anymore.  But in its day it was.  Great product and if you don't need the bells and whistles (or color display)...go for this.  Totally flawless.  People often complain about the styli of other PDAs.  No complaints here.  Not only is it relatively comfortable, it is stainless tipped with plastic on both ends (doesn't break) and it stays securely in place when you store it in the device.  I literally lost my ORIGINAL stylus just a few days ago.  

The display is not as easy to read as the new super crisp glossy screens that are out now, but if you need a basic device with a few bells and whistles that are thrown in for fun (heck, a good deal of the new ones don't have IR)... go for it.  And for the price I just saw it listed for on Amazon ($85) it's a total steal.  Great product

The item works perfectly if you do not place it near other mechanical devices, i.e. TV, air purifier, elec. clock, etc.  Fortunately it hasn't alerted us yet so that will remain to be experienced.  You have to turn it a
number of directions until you get the best reception, then leave it in that  position

This is the best value you can get. Awesome picture with 10,000:1 Contrast Ratio. My XBOX 360 looks amazing with 1080i resolution. Definitely worth the money. You would not be disappointed with this TV.

I got this on sale for $80 and i love it. It holds about 300 songs, gets plenty loud, has amazingly good battery life, and takes all my abuse. I play it at least 2 hours a night, if not all night, its my alarm in the morning, i listen to it in the car, on the bus, before school, during lunch, ok how bout his i use it a ton. I never leave home without it its small, easy and comfortable to hold, and it wont die if you drop it. Wiht my previous player I had an issue with it erasing all the songs and i know other people who have had that issue with other players but this one hasn't let me down yet. O &amp; one big plus the battery back is attached so it will never dissapear

I bought this to record interviews done primarily on the phone and it's worked beautifully. Clear and easy to use. Once downloaded onto my computer I used the Olympus transcription package to transcribe the interviews. This allowed me to listen on headphones, control the progression (and backtracking)of the interview with a foot pedal and keep both hands on the keyboard to type quickly. This voice recorder plus the transcription package dramatically cut the amount of time I had to take trascribing the interviews. Well worth the price. I'd recommend this combo highly, especially to other journalists.

I've been very pleased with this external drive-500GB. My only comments would be that at first the drive was a little 'hit or miss' with mounting on the desktop but a restart would always fix it. Now it seems to always mount. Its all automatic so no need to ever touch the drive. The other thing would be that it could use one more FireWire 400 port (there is only one). I don't use 800 yet so I need to daisy it off of my SmartDisk FireLite that happens to have 2. All in All-Get this drive

Solid product.  Headphone/speaker jack on my laptop died and manufacturer wanted $40 just to cover shipping fees to have it fixed!  I bought this great little unit instead for under $30.  Good audio.  Actually, it saved my laptop once too, laptop fell from 2-3 feet but landed right on the rubberized Turtle Beach Micro, which took most of the force.  It was bent 90 degrees at the USB connector but it still worked!  Proof of solid construction..

This is our first LCD TV.  Our tube TV finally died.  My wife actually picked out this unit and Consumer Reports also recommended this unit.  We purchased it directly from AMAZON on January 23, 2007.  I wanted to wait a couple of months before I write my review to see if anything happens. But to my surprise the TV is still running and there have been no problems.  We have digital HD and the pictures are great.  It took me a couple of weeks to get use to watching tv with such sharp color and contrast.  However, if you are watching normal digital programming you may not be too happy as it is flat.  But overall its a good buy for us

I researched TVs for a long time before I ended up buying this set.  It helped that Costco offered a coupon for $300 off the price ($1000 final price).   I thought I may not like the TV, so I decided to buy in person as opposed to online to help with a potential return.  However, there is no way I am returning this TV; it's awesome.  The picture is great, and that is just with SD.  The Strech feature makes the regular 4:3 picture fit the screen and not look distored.  I was worried about buying the 37" TV and then having to watch with the black bars on the sides to avoid distortion.  But there is no need with this TV since Sharp has figured out how to strech the picture without distortion.  DVDs look incredible on this TV as well.   What is even better is the built-in HD tuner.  I was debating upgrading my cable to the HD package, but I decide to spend $13 on "rabbit ears" from Target.  Oh my, once I plugged in the indoor antenna and let the TV track for digital stations I was amazed.  The analog station popped up like a fierce snowstorm in winter, but when I went up to the HD digital companion station, I couldn't believe my eyes.  An incredible HD picture with the rabbit ears set on my desk...indoors no less!   Why would I upgrade my cable TV to the HD package when they can't offer the local stations in HD?  Especially when they are FREE with a simple antenna!  I was told this was possible, but quite frankly I was skeptical.  Not anymore, I am so glad I got the Sharp that has the built-in tuner.  I seriously considered just buying the HD ready TV monitor and upgrade through my cable provider.  Boy am I glad that I didn't do that.  If you are in the market for a very nice TV that is easy to use and provides a great picture, I would highly recommend this set.

This is a great product. It was easy to mount and looks great. The only thing that could make it better is if it let the tv rest closer to the wall, but from what I have seen they all sit out from the wall about two inches. I have a 32" LCD mounted on it and it seems pretty heavy for the mount so I always try to keep it closer to the wall, but every time I come home my wife has it extended all the way and swung over 45 degrees. This hasn't caused any problems and I'm sure this is well within its design strength. 

Highly Reccommended

This is a high quality, precision made piece. I'm very particular about the construction of things that I buy and this Peerless arm more than met my expectations. It was easy to attach to the back of my 32" LCD television and equally easy to mount to the wall. I read a review of another arm where the buyer complained that there were many pieces to assemble. Not so here. Everything is assembled except for the mounting plates that attach to the back of the screen. All hardware is included along with clear, complete instructions. I'd be surprised if you could find something better

Pros:
Like a quality piano, the keys give a sense of weight, the bend in the keyboard tool some getting used too but now am typing a full speed.  The mouse offers great control, though I haven't much used all the buttons that are one the form.

Cons:
The only gotcha is if the computer freezes, there is no way to control-alt-delete.  Also, Setting the favorite keys to non microsoft items tends to reset after updates and restarts

One warning for users with over head lights.  The 6000 keyboard that has tranparent (light gray) keys is very hard to read if the lighting is not quite right.  I have a light directly above my desk  and the reflected glare off the keys makes all the letters and numbers disappear.  Go for a black key or similar model

After going through nearly 6 mouses (including several of the Microsoft mouses), I settled on this because its round contuour shape and large effective button area that extend very far back. It also works with my KVM switch, which is a key consideration. The buttons are a bit stiff but I expect them to "loosen" up a bit after some use. I highly recommend this mouse

Like so many other small home office users, I have recently upgraded my network to 1000mpbs to help increase productivity.  Unfortunately, I originally purchased a GigE 8 port switch from another mfg. that used a fan on their switch, a VERY noisy fan.  After a month of listening to what sounded like an airplane engine, I tossed that unit and purchased this 8port Netgear GigE unit.  It is SILENT.  Basically a plug and play item due to its unmanaged nature, I have had good data thru put and no problem.  It comes with a small clip on stand for vertical storage if desired.  The unit is finished in an attractive gray and chrome exterior.  It is also small enough to live on a desktop with sucking up valuable real estate.

So, if you are looking for a switch that will not be stored remotely in some closet, this is the one that will keep the peace in your office. A+ ****

     This card, using VIA's superb Envy24 HT chipset, is a huge improvement over my Realtek and VIA Envy24HT-S based cards.  Everything sounds better.  

     My old Audigy 2 platinum (which I think I shall melt) did better in 3D games, but only slightly. Since this card doesn't snap, crackle, and pop like the Creative cards do, I'll venture to say that it actually DOES make games better, since there are no weird noises distracting from the feel of the game.

     PROS:
* Very high audio sampling rates, allowing for incredibly good audio production; warm, rich, warm bass all the way up to crystal clear highs.
* No crackling, popping, or hissing!  A real joy after pulling my hair out for years trying to figure out why Creative Labs cards keep doing this.
* Well-maintained, solid drivers.
* Supports EAX 2.0
* Excellent ASIO support.

     CONS:
* No hardware support for DirectSound; however, if your machine is faster than about 1GHz, you probably won't notice the difference.  Benchmark your results on a machine made in the last three years and you'll find that no hardware DirectSound acceleration amounts to *less* than a 1% difference in speed.
* Only supports up to EAX 2.0, due to Creative Labs refusing to license the technology.  Sound difference is minimal, though

I'm using this Monster cable to connect my iPod to my receiver via an iPod dock and it works flawlessly.  Sound is crisp and clear.  Plus, it's a lot cheaper than getting the actual Monster iPod AV cable.  The length of the cable makes it convenient but not too cumbersome.  It's a great way to increase the functionality of your iPod

Within about 12 seconds of opening the box I was listening to my IPOD on my home stereo.  Wires are well made.

There may be cheaper options that work as well but these will last forever

I ordered a pair of these online, a bit nervous as I wasn't ever able to hear them (I heard a pair of JBL SP6C's, the cheaper version, at Best Buy, and wasn't all that impressed, although it might have been the poor listening environment).  

Anyway, the speakers arrived, we installed them (they look great and inconspicuous in our living room ceiling) and I'm quite impressed.  Note that we're using these for "whole-house" background music, not home theater, so my standards aren't as high as they would be in the HT case.  But for a 6.5" speaker, these put out a surprising amount of bass, and clear highs.  Right now we just have a cheap amplifier hooked up while we're shopping for a better one, and they still sound great.  These probably would be just fine for HT rear-speaker use (I wouldn't want any in-ceiling speaker for front or center HT use).

Our home theater downstairs already has JBL speakers (studio series for the fronts and center, northridge for the rears) and I've been very happy with them.  

I recommend these for those who need a great looking and decent sounding in-ceiling speaker without breaking the bank.

Bought 2 of these to watch over my house while I am at work.  Setup is pretty easy, but be prepared to wait a minute after changed settings, many changes when you initial setup the camera require it to restart.  Camera's work great together and the free use of [...] to access the cameras is nice.  Setting up timers and sensor emails/ftp is pretty straight forward but will require a user to test and retest to get the settings just right.

Pros: Price is good for a ip camera with tilt/pan.  viewnetcam.com feature is a great addition to the camera package.  Works great with similar model panasonic cameras.

Cons: Multiple restarts while setting up or making changes(minor issue), limited online support/how-to's

After reading all the connection problems with wireless IP cameras , I decided to purchase the wired ver. (BL-C10A panasonic). I was very pleased with the easy setup and dns service included for the camera . I currently use this camera in a cabin , so I can look in and see the temp. inside and look around. This is simpe remote monitoring , as hookup took less than 1.hr to get up and running. I do not use the emailing feature presently .
Pros : simple to setup and get running over internet
       price is reasonable
       images are the best for a camera this cheap
       using viewnet  (dns service) very easy  
Cons : wired to the router 
       no included light leds (but at this price)
       must use timer to reset ip camera (cheap house timer every 24hrs

The product works well for my space and needs. One note to Amaazon. When you ship a $400 item, thats semi fragile, and the box shows up looking like it was used as a make shift soccer ball, how does the consumer deal with physical damage? The item is so massive to ship back, and most likey costly.
I experimented with buying an expensive electronic online because the price was right. I was worried how the shipping would be handled, and sure enough, I was worried rightfully. The DVD tray catches everytime the tray comes in and goes out. The top of the receiver/dvd player had been slightly caved in. Even with all the packing Samsung supplied, it could not protect the product from the shipping company. It will be such a hassle to try and exchange this, that I am not sure if I will be purchasing something this expensive and fragile online again. Other than that, I have purchased smaller items, and less fragile from Amazon with no issues. I realize that the shipping damage canot be held on Amazon, as it is out of their control. I just don't think I will roll the dice on something like this in the future. Too bad, it would have been nice to say good buy to brick and mortar pressure salesmen

Not quite as bright a conventional flashlight, but certainly bright enough. No battery feature can't be beat. Manufacturer claims it will stay on for a hour with a one minute wind. I've never left mine on that long, but I've only needed to wind it once in over a year. This is an excellent flashlight. I've bought several

I was unsure of whether to purchase this product when I saw that my printer (HP Deskjet 712C) was not on the list put out by the manufacturer but after reading some others' reviews, I tried it anyway because the price was right.  It may look a little cheesy but it works.  I didn't even need the CD that comes with it in order to use the product.  I just plugged it in to my printer and then into my new Dell laptop and it worked.  I think I may have had to restart and add my printer but that was it.  Very good product

I was looking for a tv that offered bang for buck.  So I knew Samsung is the way to go.  Except my wife was not eager as I was, but soon after buying it The Planet Earth HD Discovery channel show was on.  Now I can not get my wife to stop talking about HD.  We love the TV not the best tv, but best for the price.  Nice design and easy to use

I have had my Samsung for about three weeks now; no problems.  I am extremely hapy with the picture quality and the number of inputs.  We also bought the 42" plasma for my parents; we've been extremely happy with it as well.  In addition to the television, I am extrmemly happy with Amazon and the delivery process.  Everythin was handled very professionally.  The tv arrived within the timeframe and undamaged.  I will buy next tv through Amazon as well

After reading several reviews on this unit, we purchased it.  The majority of our equipment supported gigabit and so we decided it was time to "get in the game".  It took less then 15 minutes to install in our rack and change over to it.  All I can say is "wow"!  The performance is phenomenal.  We have had no issue with it since switching over and it just plain works.  I cannot believe that we can obtain that level of speed in network applications for the price we paid.  Highly recommended

I bought this product mainly for my girlfriend to use on my computer. I find myself using it most of the time, now!  The mouse is great, lost of extra buttons on it (not that I need them, but it makes it a little more convenient in case I do.)  The Keyboard is great...lots of shortcut buttons right on the keyboard, making navigation VERY easy.  A couple of features on the keyboard I really like are the scroll whell on the left, the favorites buttons (all customizable, as are all the shortcut buttons on this keyboard) and the very comfortable hand rest.  I got this refurbished and it works like new!  I HIGHLY suggest this.  The only drawback is that it is a little bigger than I would have liked, but I don't mind it nearly as much as my girlfriend.  If that's not a problem, I highly suggest this product!!

This is a surprisingly good radio at this price. It is small, compact and yet very robust and quite heavy. It is nothing like the cheapie plastic radios one sees in the drug store. Here are three things I really liked about this product: 1) The AM/FM reception is outstanding. I am in a bad area with few stations and this model gets them in clean and clear. Listening to FM on my stereo headphones was a real pleasure. 2) The buttons and controls are easy to use and sensible in function. This is something Sangean seems to get very well. 3) The multi-level display lighting can be turned OFF, or up in 3 steps from dull to very bright. 

A few things I didn't like. The pilot light for "ON" is a like an intense blue laser and lights up the entire room at night. I had to put black electrical tape over it. The AUX input is a mini-jack instead of RCA connector. Minor inconvenience here. And finally, the cabinet is nice wood, but the finish is not as good as I think it could be. 

This radio is a pleasure to use and it sounds better than I expected for this price. It's a keeper

I want the DVDs I'm making to last to as close to forever as possible, so I did a lot of research before deciding what DVDs to buy.  Verbatim came out as #1 for durability.  I chose the DVD-R format for maximum compatibility with various devices.  And I've only had a few errors after burning about 75 DVDs.

Amazon's sale price for these was great.  If you're just looking for short-term backup media, I'm sure you can find cheaper, but these are a different class of DVDs

This performs better than the unit offered at the Apple store at about 20% of the cost! Plus it has an indicator light and the folding plug is handy for travel. Good deal

I had an old Palm m100 for the longest time and used it as an electronic replacement for a paper organizer. But it ate batteries and wasn't rechargeable, so when I got a newer computer without a serial port (and discovered it would cost a fairly decent sum for a serial-USB connector), I decided to upgrade. Thought it'd be cool to have something with mp3 playing capabilities as well, (I don't own an iPod or other small mp3 player) but I didn't need many features beyond an organizer (didn't need for e-mail, etc) and didn't want to spend much over $75. 

Pros: 
I like the Palm interface, very intuitive.
Calendar &amp; contacts work well
Plays mp3's
Syncs well with Outlook/computer
Plugs in to recharge; all cords came with it.
Easy to download new software (I recommend Blocks, it's similar to Tetris)

Cons or caveats:
Display: when viewing calendar in "full month" mode, I have trouble seeing any entries unless I view the screen at an angle. Not a deal-breaker, but a little odd. They probably improved this with newer (pricier) models, but you get what you pay for. I can read all other screens just fine.
Haven't used it to display photos; I don't think I'd use this to do that--resolution isn't worth the effort.
Expansion card: WARNING: WILL NOT READ ANY CARD OVER 1GB size! (I had purchased a 2GB card with the intent of putting mp3's on it and listening to them on the Zire. Wouldn't read it. Didn't realize this till I read the fine print. Fortunately, I have a camera which takes SD cards so I can use in the camera).
Listening to mp3's: This really isn't gonna replace an iPod for features. They do say that listening to mp3's uses more battery than other functions. I would agree but then I've not used this for long periods of time as an mp3 player, so I can't really say. Functionally, mp3's play just fine with RealOne player. Sound quality is pretty good BUT I have noticed a "hiss" background noise when using earbud-style headphones; it's a lot less noticeable with "outside-the-ear" style headphones. Recommendation: outside-the-ear style headphones with an in-line (cord) volume control. If you're in a quiet environment, the lowest volume level on the RealOne player isn't all that soft. With non-volume-adjustment headphones, the lowest volume level (there's a slider bar on screen) was the loudest I wanted to hear. Headphones with a volume adjustment fixes that problem.

Overall, it's been worth the $$ for me as a replacement for my former m100, and it works ok as an mp3 player, as long as you can recharge it on a regular basis

This arm-band is surprisingly good.  I initially got it for my boyfriend for his iRiver, but I was afraid it wouldn't fit his arms since he's very muscular.  Surprisingly - it stretched enough and wasn't tight!  He loves it.  I thought there might be too much motion on mine when I run or use the eliptical, but no, it's fine

This receiver puts out a lot of power. It also has a bit of weight to it. It comes with a microphone to automatically adjust it for optimal surround sound. The remote take some getting used to but it is great how you can hook up a DVD player, CD player, radio and many other devices. The display is nice. You really have to read the manual before you start plugging away. If you're a surround sound fan on a budget pick this up

A couple years ago I got a projector for the "big screen effect", and decided to finally get my mini Advents out of storage for the surround sound. My OLD Pioneer receiver worked ok, but I decided it was time to upgrade. I have 30 year old Speaker Lab (build 'em yourself) speakers up front with the Advents in back.
The only complaint I have with this unit is there is no way to connect a turn table (yes, I'm old). So I kept the Pioneer for dedicated service to the record player.
I have my son hook everything up as he is taking networking in school. For him it's a breeze. I don't even look at the directions. I just say "here".
Having said that; I think this thing is great! If you are my age and can go back 30 years to your first sound system, you paid a lot more to get a simple 200 watt system (WOW) for your records and cassettes. Ahh.... technology.
I love this thing! I can understand that some folks want something better, but for 95% of us, this will be the last one you will ever need.
Highly recommended.
4 stars for the lack of LP connection. Otherwise.... 5 all the way

I just got mine from Amazon (after a lengthly delay).  It is an awesome memory card.  It comes with the adapter so that you can use it in digital cameras.  I tested it on the camera and it worked great.  The real test was the compatibility with the SONY PSP.  No issues there.   The card worked flawlessly.  I've already used up 600 MB.....its a must buy!

Plus, at $99.99, its much less than other retailers.   btw, i ordered it at $104.99, then contacted amazon about the price drop.  They credited the difference to me without any hassle and gave me the one-day shipping at no charge because of the delay.  Overall great service too.

I use this 1GB card in my Sony Playstation Portable, and it is awesome!  The tranfer rate using the USB 2.0 cable to the PSP is very good, and I love having all that storage space for movies, music, and images.  I got the Ultra II because I had read that Sandisk outperformed Sony in speed tests, and I have to agree.  The tranfer rate seems much faster than with the 32MB Sony card that came with the PSP.  For an extra $5-$10 I got the Ultra II that has a warranty and better performance.  I think it is well worth it

The BCI-3eBk is good quality black ink for an inkjet printer.  I have used this ink for a couple of years now and don't recall it smudging on the pages I print.  The price on this product (compared to HP products) is fair, but I am able to print a 100 to 200 pages before running out of ink.  Of course, you will get more pages out of this cartridge if you print more color graphics than text

The first one I ordered worked for about four days and then stopped recognizing the USB devices I was plugging into it.  Although I had considered just getting a refund, Amazon was quick to replace the card with no hassles.  The replacement card has been working fine for a couple of months now.  The USB 2 is much faster than the original USB ports that were a part of my original computer and this particular card was a reasonable price

I own the HP 475 and since it's slightly larger then the rest, the printer barely fits in the case. It does fit but it is very tight. I would not recommend this for the 475. Probably I shouldn't have bought this but I really liked the case

I wish Targus made the same bag just a few inches wider.  My Toshiba 2600 barely squeezes in the bag.  However, it does fit and I was able to mount it between the two seats of our 2004 Toyota Sienna with no problems.  There's also ample room for cords and DVDs. 

I like how this bag doubles as a storage case and a way to mount it in the car for viewing.  

All in all, a very nice product.

There are some things I like about this, others I don't. Some people have written similar reviews, but I want to add my 2 cents. Hope this helps potential buyers.

Likes:
1. Small, easy to use
2. Good sound quality
3. Good storage capacity for those of us who don't have 10 million songs hanging out on our computers.
4. Some people have complained that the Creative Media software is hard to understand. I disagree, I found it straightforward. You can even change the titles, artists, and genres of the songs on the software before it gets transferred to the player. Yes, I realize this can also be done in WMP, but sometimes you want to edit later, or you missed something earlier.
5. Replaceable battery. If it dies, you can get another one, you don't have to send it in to the company.

Dislikes:
1. The shuffle mode is annoying. It doesn't go through the entire playlist on shuffle. Once a song is over, it goes right back onto the potential playlist, and can sometimes get played again fairly soon after it was first played, to the exclusion of the other items on the list. I want to hear all my songs at least once before I hear repeats.
2. The Creative Media Center software doesn't install on Windows Vista.
3. This is a hard drive player, so no running with it. That's okay though for people like me: I don't run. It also makes it cheaper than the IPod Nano, which is a flash player.
4. The cable to recharge the battery is a usb cable that hooks directly into your computer. I don't like this because I'm not always around my computer, I don't lug it with me everywhere I go. However, there are ports you can buy (here on Amazon, even) that plug into the wall and have little usb ports, so that's handy.
5. Not as many accessories as the IPod, but not that important.
6. You can't view your photos while you are listening to music. Sometimes this sucks, but if you have a camera phone, or are in an actual conversation with someone, you probably won't be listening to your music anyway.

The color is a classic, the only problem I have with it is that the CD pockets are very flimsy other than that the exterior of this piece is unbelievable. I love it!!! I actually bought another one, oh another note do be careful because the if you don't handle the zipper with care it tends to get caught. But nothing major :

The very first DVD player I bought was Sony's very first 5 Disc DVD changer back in 1998. It was an excellent player, but as the technology improved, it could no longer keep up. I upgraded to a single disc Sony which could handle DTS, and later to another single disc player which could handle progressive video. But I always missed the convenience of a 5 disc changer after having been spoiled by one at the start. At about one-third the price of that original DVD changer, this player has all the features of those previous upgrades and more while retaining the familiar functionality of my first player. It produces an excellent picture, has lots of tweakable settings, has more outputs, and is also very stylish looking.

I do have a couple of nits, though. My original DVD changer had buttons on the remote which allowed me to jump directly to whichever disc I wanted. With this one, I have to press a Disc Skip button to cycle through all the discs until I reach the one I want. The front of the player does have direct access buttons, though. I wish I still had my old remote control as I'm sure it would work with this unit to restore that remote functionality.

Second, the upscaling through HDMI produces a great image, but not really any better than leaving the image at 720x480p. In fact, upscaling will sometimes magnify some interlacing artifacts visible in the picture. It's also unfortunate that while connected through HDMI, progressive scan cannot be turned off. This shouldn't be an issue most of the time, but there are some video sources that might look better with it turned off. Progressive settings can only be changed on the unit itself and not through the remote, but they cannot be turned off when connected through HDMI. 

One last thing about the HDMI connection. There can sometimes be a noticeable audio sync issue when using HDMI connections and digital TVs. This is not a problem with the player, but with the way HDMI is currently implemented. This player has an audio-sync adjustment feature which should compensate for the problem. However, the audio-sync adjustment doesn't work if the player is connected to a receiver via its optical digital outputs. Since I need to have mine connected this way in order to enjoy 5.1 sound, the audio-sync adjustment feature is useless here. And that's a shame. By the way, there should be no audio-sync issues if the player is connected via component, s-video, or composite outputs.

There's also a minor thing I've found about all my Sony DVD players that I haven't liked. They are unable to correctly display Time Remaining on certain discs, or more commonly on the special features (documentaries, etc.) on certain discs. I also have a cheapo Philips player which has no problems displaying Time Remaining on those things (even on the menu). It's an improvement I'd really like to see implemented on future players.

Now, despite the complaints I've listed above, don't get me wrong. This is still an excellent player and I really love it. I happily recommend it to anyone considering purchasing it. It really is a great value and it performs very well in most instances, and I feel it's the best DVD player I've ever owned. It's just not quite perfect. In all likelihood, it's also the last DVD player I'll ever own as I'll probably be buying a BluRay or other HD player in a couple of years when that format war is over. But this is a great player to hold me over until then

These headphones sound pretty good, but they aren't the best.  When running, the volume controller gets in the way and bounces.  It is also easy to change the volume which is annoying.  I also find the fact that the cord for the right side is longer than the other a little bit strange.  I realize it is done intentionally, but it does nothing for me.  Overall, for just listening at your desk or in your room, these are great headphones.  For running, I would recommend something else

I installed this antenna in my Pawn Shop where we keep most of our electronics running all day. I could never get good reception with standard antennas and now this single antenna does the job better than any I have ever seen. Keep in mind that I have a full surveillance systen, alarm syster, phone system, 20 home stereos, a dozen or more computers and on and on. The Terk FM-50 has exceeded my expectations.  Thanks, Joel DBA Pawn-Plus

Radio reception in my apartment is terrible.  I have purchased a few indoor antennas, even a different Terk model, but none of them helped very much. I had to move the antenna around to different areas for different stations, and my digital FM radio only received one digital channel.

This unit, however, works great.  I get every station I want, and the digital FM works great.  The only thing I would mention is that the antenna casing is bulky, so if you're concerned about asthetics you'll have to figure out where you can conceal it.  Also, I didn't get any additional benefit from the amplifier, but the antenna worked so well that I didn't need it

After reading several reviews on portable speakers, I decided to purchase the Sonic Impact i-F2 for my iPod.  It has great sound quality, the case is durable, it packs away easily and you can take it anywhere.  You can listen to music while its charging and the sounds system is quite attractive.  This is by far the best accessory I've purchased for my iPod.  Did I mention that it has a remote control!!

Remember back in the day when CDs first came out? I do: hi-fi shops and all my male relatives proudly did these demonstrations of scatching a cd, putting it into a player, PLAY &amp;  *presto* the disc played.

Well, either they were making bomb-proof players back thens or the laser never got to the scratched bit of the disc because I used to have piles of discs were handled carelessly and didn't play. Yes, you read correctly: I USED to have stacks of unplayable discs.

If you don't read any further, you can stop at the end of this sentence: SKIP DR WORKS!

Here's the short of it

1. I have my own multination consulting firm
2. I have worked with computer in the media and creative industries for over 20 years
3. I dislike misleading reviews
4. I dislike wasting my time looking for products that work
5. I dislike being lied to &amp; wasting my money and 
6. I dislike people aggressively selling me stuff that they have little knowledge about &amp; frankly doesn't work 

On top of that, I am impressed NEITHER by people that trash products that do work NOR people that work for certain manufacturers, create ghost profiles and trump up their employer's products.

SKIP DOCTORS works. 

I own over 3,500 discs. Out of that number, I had countless discs -- from my beloved Trance Planet disc, a Jessye Norman classical and spirituals collection, stuff by Miles Davis, reams of and Nina Simone compilations to computer program discs, backups of various creative projects, rare SACDs (SuperAudio CDs) and stuff that got mangled at parties or  being dragged around the world before CreativeLabs and Ipod came on the scene -- that were ALL unreadable. 

I have seen the sprays, I have seen the wipes, I have seen the low grade sandpaper product, I have tried using BRASSO metal polish (a remedy recommended by a friend of mine from Venezuela -- and for little scratches actually works) and low-grade industrial solvent. HANDS DOWN, short of the industrial strength polishing machines (that handle 500 plus discs at a time and go from $1500 to over $5000), SKIP DR (and all its incarnations GAME DR / DVD DR / PHOTO DR) WORKS. Period.


Why did I only rate the product '4 stars'?

Simple: this review is about the mechanical version of the product. And I am lazy: mechanised means EFFORT. 


Will I buy the mechanised version?

Definitely! The product is in my shopping basket will be ordered (when I finish writing this review to set the record straight!

They say it's quiet, and it holds tons of data.  They were correct.  Fast access speed, easy installation, an overall fine product.  Have not used the feature that let's you back-up your entire drive, but we use it in our LAN for shared files, and it's comforting to know that we've got these files stored redundantly.  This box does just what it claims to do, the warranty of merchantability (from my old law class!).

The Edge 305 provides a wealth of knowledge, is easy to install, as well as use. I would love to have given it 5 stars (it deserves them), but one thing that does not work correctly, and really bugs me is the calories expended. It couldn't be more inaccurate if they tried to make it that way. The first day that I installed it, I took it for a quick 1 mile test ride. IT indicated that in that mile I burned 100+ calories. Wish it were true, but it is not. Unfortunetly the next day I was going to take it out on a 100 mile ride, but crashed as I started out and have not riden since (3 days). I wore the chest strap in the office today to test the calories burned further. After 2 hours it read 0 were burned. I just took it for a car ride of 7 miles. In those 7 miles DRIVEN IN A CAR, it indicates I burned nearly 600 calories, again I wish, but no way.

Other than that flaw, whioh I hope they fix with a software update, I highly recommend this product, it all other ways it is great

Buying from Amazon was cheapest price especially with free shipping.  Stepped up for more power per channel.  Stayed in the Sony family. (Previous Sony surround, output to center speaker quit)  Dislike the speaker hook ups in back, difficult to attach speaker wires and screw down connections.  Overall happy with purchase

According to other reviews, this radio compares favorably with others in its price class.

As a ham radio operator I can say I am very happy with the E5.  It is the best portable Broadcast band radio I have ever had.

It is the best portable Shortwave radio I have ever had.

I was particularly interested in SSB capability.  It works well.


I called about the noisy power supply and they are sending me the improved replacement.  I use 2100 mah Nimh batteries which I charge externally.  I have two sets.  The radio works well with these.

I found that the internal antenna by itself, indoors, is not enough.  I used the included wire antenna with moderately good results.  But more convient is using the telescoping antenna.  This antenna works, according to the manual, for FM and SW only, but I found that extending it fully, is effective in all cases.  Ressults using this method were similar to the wire.

Holding the radio and using the headset may also improve reception.

Hams know that the antenna is a critical part of any receiver.  There are limits to what is possible in a package this size.  I have not tested it with a tuned outdoor antenna.

For what it is, this is a great tool.  It is a convient size and easy to program and use.  It more than meets my expectations.

I bought these for my dvd player.  They work wonderfully!  The old analog cables that came with the dvd player looked alright but [didn't measure up}.  These monster cables definately enhance the sound of my dvd movies, especially the dialogue.  The old cables that I had made my movies sound a bit muffled.  But the monster cables intensified the clarity from the dvd player to my reciever.  For those of us who cannot afford 5 speaker digital surround sound, I would definately recommend these cables if you use regular 2 channel stereo for your movies or CDs

The Belkin TuneTalk is fabuous for using an iPod as a digital recorder. I have had very good results recording various music rehearsals (children's choir to big band) with and without an external powered microphone (Sony ECM-MS908C stereo mic) attached. Since I already had the mic, the total cost was very low compared to purchasing something like a Zoom digital recorder for this type of recording. I haven't plugged it into a mixing board yet. I suspect it would produce an even better recording with a decent pair of mics through a Mackie 1202 or better.

I bought a USB power adaptor so I wouldn't have to worry about battery drain. It plugs into the TuneTalk and provides power to the iPod.

No, it isn't as good as a high dollar recorder, dedicated mic-pre's and a pair of Neumann mics. Serious recording requires serious equipment. However, for all those other recordings, the Tunetalk Stereo is a great recording option for about $60 and your trusty iPod.

I saw the small size of this case and was in love.  It has plenty of space for dvds and cords (though it wont hold large headphones unless they fold).  It is padded enough for protection but not too padded to be too bulky.  It's Great.  You wont regret it.

when i first got this mp3 and opened up the box i was surprised how small it is.  about the size of a piece of chewing gum.  i installed the program via the included cd and it worked right away with no problem what so ever.  this held all the music i had on my lap top with lots of room to spare.  the program is easy to use and downloading music to the player is fast and easy.  the sound is outstanding with the ear-bud headphones that are included.  the fm works well and the display is back-light and very easy to read. all of the players options are user friendly and do not require a lot of skill to use.  this is one piece of electronics that will not drive you mad with hard to use software or directions.  as an added bonus they included batteries.  this is one of my favorite gadgets and i would recommend the 1 gig for any user.  it is not expensive at all and really who needs more music than this holds

I really needed a printer with a scanner so I could store my important files digitally.  This printer works great.. I would recommend to change to the lower resolution so it will operate faster.  It can scan color also but that takes a loooong time.  b&amp;w has been sufficient for me; scans quickly for those.  printout quality is excellent

This is my second projector - I used an NEC for the last four years, but that died on me recently.  And, boy, am I glad it died - I am amazed by the quality of the AX100U - the pictures and colors almost  jump off the screen at you.  Also, the oft mentioned LDC projector 'screen door' effect is virtually non-existant - you have to stand almost next to the screen to notice it.  I believe Panny used some smoothening technology to achieve it.  The contrast is also truely outstanding for an LCD projector - at par with DLP systesm, but without the headaches of the rainbow effect.

Couple of pointers which might be helpful to other users.  When I first started using the projector with my DVD player I was getting some wavy curls (not too visible, but still there) that seemed to flow across the screeen.  However, after about 4-5 hours of use, they have disappeared - so if any of you see those wavy curls, just give it a few hours and hopefully yours will disappear as well.

Secondly, unlike my old NEC I was getting a flickering shimmer when using my HD box from my cable company.  The shimmer was just at the edge of teh picture.  There is an easy fix for this.  Go to options, overscan, and you can actually crop the edge of the image and  not see it any more...voila - no flickers and an incredible picture. 

Be aware that this is big, bulky projector compared to some others out there.  Definately not a portable one - you don't want to be lugging it home from work after presentations to see home pictures.  This was designed as a dedicated home theater projector, not a portable presentation device.  

I highly recommend this projector - you've got to see the picture to believe it - I didn't think it was possible at this price range.

I was very surprised at how well this sub articulates the low frequencies.  Hearing is believing.  It gives a certain amount of accuracy and tangibility to base tones that I simply was not able to obtain with a higher priced sub I had purchased.  For movies, it does a wonderful job of augmenting the atmosphere of scenes without being too boomy.  It really enhances music by bringing out lower notes and sounds that are not normally perceived with the use of most other subwoofers on the market.  I am not certain it can go as low as 27Hz since I have not measured, but I am not concerned with trying to disturb the neighbors or shake the walls.  I just wanted to obtain the most precies and best sounding system I could.  I was able to do so with the addition of this sub.  I am glad I found and tried it before paying much more for another sub I was considering.

Yet I hate the fact that it is advertised as being a 250-watt sub.  Its Peak Dynamic Power is 250 watts.  But the amplifier it contains is a 150 watt amplifier.  Therefore, it is a 150-watt sub

Pros: Very inexpensive, can play songs directly from a flash drive instead of an mp3 player
Cons: Can't shuffle tracks or make a playlist if you use a flash drive

Overall I'm very happy with this device. I live in a big city and had no trouble finding an FM station with little to no interference. I love being able to play tracks directly from a flash drive without having to bring my mp3 player with me in the car all the time. The sound quality is good, but not perfect. Similar to playing a cassette instead of a CD. For the low price, I can't complain, though

I purchased this remote to replace a broken tv/dvd/vcr combo remote.  Before buying it I checked specs of several brands and types to see if they could be programmed for my combo.  This was the only one that definitely could. It has worked well...a couple features are not available but I expect that with any replacement control.  I've also programmed it to my bose radio and my dish network box and the controls have worked just fine.  Now my coffee table is a lot less cluttered

ive owned a couple CB's and this is definitely one of the better ones (the only ones that are better are substancially more expensive).  works great and can be mounted in dash because of the front firing speaker.  tons of features including scanning and weather (which actually comes in very handy).  the only feature it lacks (and i wish it had) is the ability to hook up to a PA.  other than that its great

I have to say this mouse pad has far exceeded anything I hoped for. When I first opened the box it was shipped in I was very put off. There was a Very, Very strong chemical smell. I chalked it up to something in the packaging material. It turns out that was not where the smell was coming from. It was the mouse pad itself. Having worked in a shoe factory years ago I was able to identify the smell as an industrial glue. The smell hung around for a couple of days. Now, 1 week after having received my purchase if I put my nose close to the pad, it still carries the faint smell of industrial glue. I would caution those with allergies and/or asthma to consider this prior to purchase. As an asthmatic I can say it did affect my breathing some what. That seems to have gotten better as the smelled has lessened. I have finished with my public health warning. On to the mouse pad. 
     It is simply the best mouse pad I have ever used. I have had wrist problems for over 4 years now. I have had swelling and pain from my right pinkie finger to my elbow as a result of console gaming and lots of keyboarding work. In the past week my swelling has greatly reduced. My pain is almost gone. My wrist sits perfectly on  the wrist rest. The pad actually cradles my wrist. The wrist rest moves with my hand, so well and with so much support, it seems to be an extension of my body. A new improved appendage. I have found myself resting my wrist on the pad even while not computing but just sitting at my desk. It truly is that comfortable. I already have plans to purchase two more for friends as Christmas gifts. Worth Every Cent! Go For It! You Will Not Be Disappointed!

It was easy to set up and use. Our remote was bad out of the box but Panasonic sent us a replacement.
We were able to record tv programs right away and then transferred our old VHS over to DVD.
It took a long time to transfer but it was worth watching the VHS tapes again to bring back memories.

I have this console for protection of master bedroom 40" LCD Samsung 1080p HDTV and Denon surrond sound 7.1 home theater system. I have been very pleased with the improved picture and sound. Before hooking up to this console, I had a slight wave going across the screen. It is now gone as is the slight buzz from the sound system.
I also have 1-2 power outages every month from new construction in our area. The console has protected all of the equipment very well. Considering the price and free shipping through Amazon, I highly recommend this console

My company purchased two of these phone a month or two back for office use.  Previously we had an AT&amp;T - which I'll probably never own again after having a Panasonic.

The phones have great voice quality - plus some nice features you don't always find, like the hold option, data port on the back, and a nice LCD screen displaying date, time, # missed calls, # messages, and in call timer.  I do wish, however, that the LCD was backlit.  Another great feature is the fact that it displays the associated caller ID stamp with the message that is playing - no more guessing who left the message when!

The phones have been standing up beyond our expectations - and I plan on buying Panasonic phones our next time around

I gave a detailed review of the base system, but the handset merits comments separately.  I have purchased handsets for every room in the house, and because I don't like using the clip to carry it with me everywhere, I use them.  They're easily customizable through the PC interface, although they can be customized without it as well.  Each handset gets its out name, so transferring calls or paging a handset is simple.  (No more trying to remember which room has the "fifth" handset.)  I've been impressed with both the battery life and the range of each handset; I've read reviews that criticized the range or sound quality, but I've had no trouble with either despite a few different usage scenarios.  If you're shopping for one of these, then you've already got the base unit or are considering purchasing it, so you know the quality to expect.  I think the Uniden CLX485 is the best residential phone system I've ever experienced; the handset lives up to that standard, too

This antenna is one of the best indoor UHF antennas, but is designed for UHF only.  Many cities use both UHF &amp; VHF for digital TV.  

To see if UHF &amp; VHF are used in your area, enter your address at www.antennaweb.org 
Then, look at the digtal channel Frequency assignments column.  If any channels are 2 thru 13, this antenna is not for you.

Do NOT buy any knockoff antennas sold by TERK.  They are mostly junk.

A fast card which works as expected.
You don't know the difference a fast card can make, unless you swap to a slower one. Even a slower camera/device will have improved performance with a faster card such as this one.

I bought these after buying TDK for the past 5 years and now only being able to get Memorex at a low price (I've had very bad experiences with Memorex CDRs in the past). These were surprisingly cheap as Verbatim is one of the highest quality blank media brands. Not surprisingly, the discs lived up to expectations on my Plextor-716A drive. I haven't tested a whole lot yet, but the ones I did test, burn flawlessly and when disc scans were run, there were no errors. You really can't go wrong with Verbatim. Just buy them

I exchange audio letters with friends, and this stereo recorder was purchased after my Sony 100 DVS died and no replacement parts were available. The sound quality is perfectly fine, though it does not pick up ambient sounds nearly as well as the old high-end machine. It comes with a stereo microphone, but it would be great if the microphone were attached to the unit -- as it is, there is a long clip-on cord. This makes it tough to do "off-the-cuff" recording. Overall, a good value for the money. The other machine cost nearly $300.

So this controller looked pretty sweet to me so I bought it over a rumble pad. I liked the idea of fans for wicking away sweat, as I tend to get pretty white knuckled on my controllers. I bought this controller specifically for Star Wars Battlefront 2 on PC, and it works like a dream. I also like the X-Box controller layout (offset anolog sticks and more ergonomic) than the PS2 style controller that is the Logitech Rumble pad. It also has better grips than a PS2 controller.

The only things I think are bad about it are the following:
1. It is not modeled on the large XBox controller, but rather the regular one, which is ok for most people, but I have big hands and I get a bit cramped up if I play for way too long.
2. I was slightly dissapointed with the lack of custimization software available with this pad. I have a Saitek Cyborg EVO joystick that you can create custom profiles for every game you want to use it with then set that profile before launching the game. This isn't an issue with Battlefront 2 since it has a very excellent in game control configurator, but I could see where if a game didn't have as good an interface (or maybe older games) this pad could suffer in this regard.
3. This isn't so much an issue for me, but I would assume that with a lot of game play and turning on and off of the fan, that the fan motor will likely die sooner than the pad will wear out. I don't care too much, because the fan is more a novelty to me than anything. I will still use it even if it does die.

Overall, a great controller, I actually would give it a 4.5 rating, but that isn't an option here

 I needed a sub for my garage, and did not want to spend more than $200. Got it on sale for well under that.

 Since this was just for the garage, when tinkering with my bikes, I didn't want something too expensive, and didn't expect much from such a small sub. I was very pleasantly suprised by it's performance, This thing will rock when needed, and hits suprisingly low for a small sub in a very large space. 

 I first tried a Polk PSW10, since Polk products had never dissapointed me in the past. Well there is always a first time... The Yamaha smokes the Polk sub, I returned the Polk immediatly. 

 Of couse it doesn't compare with the Energy S12.3 I use in my main music system, but for 1/5 the cost, I never expected it to

Maybe I'm bias because I really like Yamaha, maybe, because I have kinda' good ears or, it's the fat check sitting on my table  from Yamaha; but what ever it is I realllllllly like this sub-woofer.

 I looked around a long time for the right sub, and, I like to think I got a good one here.
 You want power? Ok, it's only 250 watts -not 1,000 watts like Velodyne, but in my room (30 by 18ish with a 25 foot ceiling) it ROCKS.
 
I love music, all kinds; loud or quiet no matter I like both, but I do like depth more than volume. However, I believe if you are going to listen to something real loud, being able to feel the music is as important as being able to here it.
And let me say you can FEEL music if you want to.
 one of the things I love most about this sub is it's range; it can (maybe) reach 20 hertz. 20 hertz! that is astounding.
20Hz is the lowest frequency the human ear can hear, in fact it's starting into the range of sounds that are felt more than heard.

Maybe I have good ears and maybe I don't, but to hear rich airy low-end, and, bass notes. yes! bass NOTES! bass is not one big boomy lump of noise, it's huge, open, grazing pasture of distinct sounds!

In short, music sounds great, even hip-hop (which I don't like) sounds, well, better.
Also, their is no need to turn the volume way up to hear a improvement; at very quiet levels too, you can hear good clean bass notes. But, if you do a lot of quite listening, we're talking back ground music levels: disable the auto-on feature and manually turn it on and off, because if you happen to be listening to something quiet, even if you still can here low notes from this, it does not seem to be enough signal to keep the auto-on, well... on.
 
It improves movies as well, take something  with a lot of dynamics like, "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" or, "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" there are a lot of sudden loud, and very low sounds in those movie's and the Yamaha handles it all with aplomb.
 
With most of the controls are on the front set-up is and tweaking is made easy, and if you are wondering about the "BASS" button: if the button is in the "music" position you will have to turn the volume to a higher level to shake the termites out of the walls than if its set to the "movie" position (I think "music" is a flatter frequency response).
 As this review seems to be getting a bit long I'll some it up:
yes, there are far better subwoofers out there (like from B&amp;W), but I don't have the money for those, and if someone gave me a 1,000 watt Velodyne I would take it in a heartbeat- but, I wouldn't want to give this one up too.
It's a absolute pleasure to listen to.


Update: I have run some test tones on this subwoofer, and well, it can not reach 20Hz. 38Hz seems to be the limit for usable bass, although it is still audible to around 32Hz, 20Hz is a stretch.
If 38Hz sounds to high: their are not many movie's or CD's that have any sounds below 35Hz. And very, very few have sound below 25Hz.
Although it does not go as low as I would have hoped, it is still a good sub for the money, and still worth a five star review

I can verify again that this is indeed 16 gauge wire. This size works very well for small-medium satellite speakers. I am using this wire with a Samsung HT-Q80 HTIB. It's working wonderfully and I'm getting nice crisp sound. Unlike the other reviewer, my spool came fully intact. I would suggest this for anybody looking for good, cheaply priced 16 gauge speaker wire

If you zoom in on the picture, you'll notice that it's actually 16 gauge wire.  I received it and can confirm that it's 16 gauge.  Wire works fine, although the spool that's held together by two bolts and nuts had one of the nuts missing.  It's not a big deal though, and my only disappointment was on my end when I realized 100' wasn't enough to hook up my 7 speakers

The card is blistering fast.  I just wish it didn't take a performance hit in Vista.  It also has several other odd issues that I've become accustomed to when buying bleeding edge technology.  (e.g. the official drivers released in February 2007 are missing several features in Windows Vista.  Like good TV-Out support, Hibernation support, proper Ntune support.  The March 2007 released Vista beta drivers seems to cause a lot of people to have video driver crashes during games.  Check Nvidia's message board for more info.)

Once Nvidia straightens out their Vista drivers issues, this card will be golden.  As it is, the latest Beta drivers did improve performance... but it introduced some stability issues.

Also, EVGA's 90-day Step-Up program will hopefully allow me to jump into the 8900 series that is rumored to be released late-April 2007.

LASTLY... it puts off an odd digital whine in 3D games and when resizing windows.  I returned one (with green circuitboard) and got a new one form Amazon (black circuitboard) and it did the same thing.  Amazon reimbursed me the return shipping!  The digital whine isn't too bad, but its fairly annoying if you have your game sound really low.  I play with headphones, so I don't really care

This is a great little machine and has so many uses.  I bought 2 of them and 2 days later came back to Amazon to buy some more for gifts and the price has doubled... what's with that?  Keep looking and you'll find this at a hot price again eventually

As headphones they work fine but the microphone falls off repeatedly and this appears to be the result of a bad design.  After the 10th time the Microphone failed entirely and refuses to work.  I've isolated the problem to the microphone itself.  As headphones they are fine but in you need a microphone you should look elsewhere.

In general, Lexar's USB drive does its job just as well as other USB drives; there isn't much of a difference except for the following:

1) portability 
good: it has a convenient way of attaching to your keychain
bad: this rubber holder only lasts for so long (in my case 6-8 months)

2) it is extremely durable. This drive survived a full 30 minute (clothes) washer cycle. When I took it out of the washer, I thought all the data and the drive was gone for good. To my surprise (after letting it dry for a day) it worked just fine. This is amazing!

I have also accidentally stepped on it while wearing shoes (not using all of my weight though) a few times on carpet and concrete; and still works fine.

Finally, I have dropped this drive on a variety of surfaces and it's still fine.

3) looks:
good: it is very easy to see since it is bright red
bad: it is fatter than other USB drives and it is bright red. The drive is pretty ugly.

It maybe good to note however, that the drive's structure is probably a good reason as to why it has survived my abuse. The bright red color's advantage has already been mentioned above

I was a little worried about spending almost 70$ on this bag, but when I recieved it I was so impressed.  I really love this bag! Very well made!! The crocadile pattern is a lot more prominent than the picture shows, but I really like it. To be honest I shy away from croc patterns, but it really works with this bag! I have a 15.4 in. Gateway laptop and it fit perfectly in this bag

I have used this machine for a few months now, but have not made use of all possible features. However, this is what I can say:

* basic copying, fax, scanning -- Excellent
* scanning with character recognition -- Excellent but would prefer to have options ala OmniPage
* duplex printing(printing on both sides) -- Very Good, except the menu digging is ackward
* build quality and overall performace -- Excellent, prints fast, few jams, feels very sturdy
* ease of use -- very good and straight forward
* features -- Excellent, loaded with capabilities

This machine is beautiful and no other machine I have used comes close, save for high end office machines costing $thousands. I can't get over how happy I am with this one, I've been waiting for a quality MFC since before they came out, and finally I am satisfied. Highly recommended

I travel overseas a lot for my job. This little power strip is compact and enables you to keep ONE adapter on the end of it to plug into the funky wall plug and then use your "normal" plugs for operating four devices. Most Monster products are terribly overpriced and not worth the money (wires, cables, etc.) but this gizmo rocks

We've only had ours a week and I wish we'd bought it sooner.  The photos are sharp and every bit as good as commercially printed ones.  I like it that they are dry and can be handled right away unlike my big HP printer's photos which stay sticky for some time.
Having this gives such freedom to print and print photos to enclose in letters, to use in scrapbooking, and to frame for your home or for gifts.  Really convenient and takes very little space on the desktop

I'm a college kid, recreational audiophile and bass fanatic, studying engineering.  I started off building a custom sub encloser with dual Kicker CompVR 12" subs driven by a 1200W Sony amp. I haven't stopped searching for great sound since.

I'm running a pair of these off an H/K AVR240, combined with a JBL EC35 center, a JBL S120PII 400w sub, and two sets of E30 surrounds.

I'm big on trying anything before I buy it.  I was able to listen to these and the E80s (the dual 6" floorstandings) at a local audio store before they were discontinued.  I loved the sound of these and the Polk and Klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics. With the JBLs at a fraction of the price here on Amazon, it was no question.  

The only issue was what model to get...
I heard very little difference in qualtiy between the E60s and E80s.  The dual 6" put out a bit lower frequencies, but the difference was so small that I wouldn't be able to notice without the speakers side by side.  Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful, but a bit overkill for what I needed.  I deceided on these over the E60s with the hopes that a single 8" would draw less from my amp than the dual 6" for a bit less money.

Beautiful home theater and music speaker...
crisp highs, defined mids, and respectable bass.  They are a bit top heavy, as any tower will be.  and I love extremely low, loud bass, and as such, I suplemented the system with a sweet JBL sub.

Movies sound great:
Saving Private Ryan, Fifth Element, 40 year old virgin, Anchorman, etc... etc...
Music is also fantastic (with different amp settings tuned for genre):
Ambient, electronica, hip-hop, rap, jazz, 80s, classical, rock.
Ulrich Schnauss, Bonobo, DJ Shadow, Busta, Snoop, E40, Louis Armstrong, Michael Jackson, Bach, Korn, Metallica, Hoobastank, 311.

If you're looking for a quality tower speaker... this is it.
Bass fanatics, look at the S120PII.  you won't regret it.

Like the name suggests, the m-audio audiophile 2496 is for true audiophiles.  I have had this card for years and there still is few options that are on par with this card for the same money.  The audiophile has a full dynamic range of crisp audio with little distortion.  I connect my sound card via digital coaxial cable to my Harman Kardon avr 240 and the sound is amazingly clear.  

The one drawback to this card is it may be difficult for some to learn to use at first.  However, when quality is essential go with the Audiophile 2496.

I have owned this backpack for almost two years and have put thousands of miles on it in NYC (my home town) and traveling on business across the US.

A place for everything and everything in its place.
First this thing has 3 major compartments and a 4th 'open' compartment; A padded laptop compartment large enough for a Mac 17" with enough room left over of books or magazines. The second compartment has an internal file folder compression panel, that keeps your paperwork flat, orderly and compressed against your body(If you ever had the paper clip come off of a 40 page document in your backpack you know how great this feature is). The final main compartment contains an integrated open-top mesh bag for your power brick and other miscellaneous computer gear. Again this has been designed to keep the weight compressed and close to your body. Each compartment has plenty of extra room beyond its required purpose. The forth 'open' compartment is stiff outer panel with a compression draw strings around the sides in which you can stuff: your book, newspaper, umbrella, rain jacket, lunch, magazine, camera, iPod or anything you need to securely stash away and retrieve at a moments notice while on the go. A great feature! Finally this rig is fitted out with no less than 5  additional zippered pockets and 4 pockets-inside-of-pockets AND: a separate gear bag, as well as a CD-ROM sleeve and a removable cell phone pocket on the shoulder strap.

The styling is professional enough of serious meetings. You can also carry the bag to the side with its well padded handle. This is key in elevators and subways.

All and all you can load this down for a 3 day road trip and it still feels solid and balanced on your back. 

Final notes: 
- Zippers are high quality with big rubber grips
- The black &amp; grey color scheme will not show dirt and wear.
- Fits snug under airline seats
- Good padding on shoulders and back panel.
- Did I mention all the pockets?

Any down side?
Having this bag becomes an exercise in self control for pack-rats. 
When full this bag is BIG. But if you don't mind looking looking geeky and knocking people over when you turn around fill it up and your good to go. Other wise just limit your stuff.

The only reason I didn't give this item 5 stars is because I have only taken it on the road once, so as of yet I can't call it a worthy 'road warrior.' However, it is certainly a great case. Proportioned well and good design, with space for essentials. Would recommend for anyone looking for a good case for their 17" widescreen notebook

I found that both the RCA and Optical cables worked flawlessly with my receiver.  I wish that the power cable was a little longer and I would've liked to have received a white ethernet cable to complete this set.  The installation of any of these cable went very easily with the on caveat that you must ensure to remove the covers on the optical cable which may not be obvious to some

My engineering classes don't allow for the TI-83,86,89.  So I needed a calculator that allowed for matrix reduction, basic vector manipulation, and single variable integration for my engineering class.  The matrix reduction capabilities has been a major time saver especially on tests, particularly for solving systems of linear equations especially in my Statics, Dynamics, and Strength of Materials Class.  The "2-Line Natural Textbook Display" prevents me from getting lost in a calculation with multiple parenthetically nested expressions and is a must have.  The "scrolling" ability to grab values from previous calculations saves time and preserves accuracy, very nice.  The only thing preventing a 5 star rating is that I thought the exterior design make is awkward to use at times, but that is because I'm used to square calculators.  Also I would have like this model offered in black

I've used the SD-YD250 hundreds of times over the last 2 years and it still shows no significant signs of wear. Overall, the product is a five star because of its reliability and labor-saving convenience. I've used it equally for baking bread and making pizza dough. It can also save a lot of money, provided you purchase the yeast in bulk (for example 2lb). The single use yeast packages which are typically the only buying option at American supermarkets cost 20 times more per gram. Particularly great savings are possible when using it to make pizza dough. This takes the tedious work out of making your own pizza, and when the dough is refrigerated for later use, it tastes even better in my opinion.

Like most engineered products of our age, this one is full of cute features that add little value, or cause annoyance.

The yeast dispenser makes a marginal difference at best. If you use it, you (for the most part) create extra work for yourself because you'll have to clean it later. 

The dozens of different bake modes make the product more complicated to use. They make a marginal difference in baking results. I only use the quick bake mode, which takes 2 hours to complete. 

Let's say you make a mistake and start the unit using the wrong settings (easy to do given the many parameters you can set). You just push the reset or cancel button and start over, right? Nope, no such button exists. Then unplug the unit and plug it back in, right? Nope, the engineers decided it would be a cute feature to protect against power outages, so the unit remembers where it left off. Yes, but the instruction manual states that you can wait 10 minutes, and after 10 minutes it will forget, right? Nope, I tried this, too. The unit does indeed forget eventually, but it's more than 11 minutes. If you plug it back too early, the timer resets and you have to wait again.

To summarize, the hardware is excellent, and the software that controls it could hardly be dumber

This product works great for my ibook G4 screen and also for cleaning off most smudges on the case, although it seems like I'm constantly getting new smudges on the screen.  Don't expect it to get off the spots that build up on keyboard over time, though.  Mr. Clean Magic Eraser works well for that ... but only if you make sure to thoroughly squeeze the water out before use on your computer.  Otherwise it may get in and ruin your keyboard

My 2 year old saw this in BJs and kept asking for it, so Santa brought it for him for Christmas. I think it's a good first guitar. He loves to strum it, but he definitely needs to be supervised to teach him to respect that it is a special musical instrument, not a toy. So far he has sat on it and used it as a drum and it's held up fine, but I don't think it would hold up with such continued abuse. It is recommended for children much older than he is, so I can't expect anything different. I do wish they made a smaller version of it so it would be more comfortable for him. For a better price than I see at Amazon, you can get a small Hohner guitar at a music store, which might be better quality, I'm not sure. Regardless, I am very happy with this guitar and I would recommend it for any child who shows a real interest in music. I would not buy it for a child just as a toy, unless you don't mind it being destroyed. I am planning to buy the guitar strap and will review that when I get it

I have both the 4 port and 2 port versions of these and they seem to work well with my Dell Optiplex 260 running Windows XP. My PowerEdge 500sc, 1400, and 1800 tend to lose the mouse and keyboard and have to be rebooted, but this may be a function of running Windows 2003 R2 on them. Also, the 1800 has a Promise SATA card which locks up with USB in general making this switch a problem (I had to go back to the PS2 KVM).  But with XP machines it seems fine

The connectpro USB KVM Switch costs a few dollars more but it really works the first time with no hassles.  I've been forced to use cheaper KVM switches at work and Windows XP never seems to play nice with them.  I use this one at home with two Linux machines and a desktop and laptop running Windows XP.  The switch worked the first time I connected everything together and has worked glitch free ever since

Very durable cables.  Was concerned about using wireless keyboard/mouse, but works great with the Microsoft Wireless Desktop, including the multimedia function keys.  Version of the switch that I received is black, not white as pictured

This Eton radio is the U.S. domestic version of the Chinese Tecsun PL-550 all-band pocket sized radio. The Chinese version is legended in the native language and utilitarian in appearance and less expensive. The Eton is, well, in English with slight curves. I have used and tested other Tecsun produced radios, including the PL-200 (Eton 10) and the Grundig eTraveller VII. This radio, like the other Tecsun models, has excellent frequency discrimination, as well as the ability to directly enter the frequency desired (if you know it), or scan through the AM, FM and many shortwave bands, find the stations you like and store their frequencies. Closely allied, for example, FM stations within 200 kHz (only the strongest will be heard on most commercial FM receivers) of each other, can be picked up with clarity, positioning the manuverable whip antenna. Very, very few radios, excepting expensive car radios, can boast such performance in the Unites States.  Now on the market are other comparable radios, all made by Tecsun in China using the very same sophisicated reception circuitry regelated previously to expensive shortwave receivers.  This model has other features as well:  two preset wake-up times for programs from preselected stations, scanning of all bands for stations and an antenna trimmer which permits optimizing reception on weakly received broadcasts, some 500 station memories and special reception selectivity for shortwave stations whose frequencies are almost overlapping.  For the price, this radio is simply an excellent value, but people wishing to receive shortwave broadcasts are warned:  shortwave reception from this radio, and every other shortwave radio for that matter, of stations other than the powerful broadcasters, benefits enormously from the use of an external long wire antenna.  Tecsun does provide a retractable wire antenna with the radio.  Alas, as with almost all radios this size, there is no single side band (SSB) reception, an enhancement that, defying digital technology, actually requires listener intervention to optimize and has great potential, but has, for the present at least, been consigned to the province of the technical listener more interested in ascertaining distant reception than actual broadcast information. The Dalai Lama for all his 5,000 watts SSB from Tibet can not be heard on this radio. China Radio shortwave, at 150,000 watts conventiona AM shortwave, with Canadian relay stations, does just fine. Australian radio, at the same power, Radio Havana, Radio Serbia, Croatia, Russia, Netherlands, Sweden, India, Israel, etc., at lesser power, and some with and most without relay stations, are also heard clearly on the Eastern seaboard during their times of broadcast - usually in the early evening EST

I've had my E-10 for around nine months and have been most impressed by it's performance. My interests in radio pretty much revolve around A.M.(or medium wave) DX'ing and shortwave listening. It's performance on A.M. is on a par with the highly regarded Kaito KA-1103 which I received for Christmas this year. Shortwave performance is very close, however, the Kaito is superior in this area (and features SSB tuning as well)F.M.? The E-10 is well above average but falls short of the Kaito KA-1103. I've yet to see a radio that can equal the Kaitos performance in this area, but the E-10 is closer than most.Build quality,ergonomics,and appearance are second to NONE and better than MOST. The slightly rubberized texture of this set just plain feels good when handling and adds to the to the overall impression that this is a "Top of the line" portable multi band receiver even though it's moderately priced.It's LCD digital display is one of the largest and nicest I've seen,very easy to see and well lit with a pleasant orange backlight. Other amenities such as 500 plus memories,12/24 hour clock,I.F. shift and antennae trim which are both useful in Shortwave reception,local/dx switch and the internal battery charger for NICAD or NIMH batteries all add up to make this a radio I'm glad I purchased and often recommend to those needing a radio of this type.Even the accessories included with this radio such as the carrying satchel,earbuds,and reel-up shortwave antennae are top notch! Now, if you're wondering why, after all this praise I only gave it a four star rating,and not a five it's because Eton did not provide SSB tuning capability on this receiver. And it's a shame because it's shortwave performance is good enough to utilize it. In my opinion they shortchanged this otherwise exceptional radio. Hence they only "hit a triple"(which is way more exciting nonetheless, I'm a baseball nut too) and not a home run

I only have a couple of problems with this remote. You have to keep pressing the buttons for dvd, vcr, audio, sat, etc. to change the setting. That sounds like I'm complaining a lot, and I am. (sue me. ha ha) The other is this. I bought this as a replacement for a remote that quit working. I can't teach it the functions that I need through the "learn" command since the orginal remote quit. Which kind of defeats the purpose of having a new remote. I have one of those all in in one home theater units and the remote wouldn't allow me to set the VCR clock and local channels after a power outage. 
Other than that, I have no problem with it

Actually, I loved the Philips Acoustic Edge, an earlier and internal sound card, but it did not like my older dual-processor system.  Because of that I was a bit skittish about using their current internal card with a processor that uses hyper-threading - which Windows treats as dual processors.  I bought the Aurelium instead.  I love this thing!  I am a bit of an audiophile, and this sound card is just perfect.  With my Klipsch computer speakers, it makes a perfect combination

I love this item.  We bought 2 cases for our sons before we left for vacation.  It can hang from the seats but they just held them on their lap or layed it on the couch in the van.  The boys arranged everything in the case so the battery even fits in it.  I was glad about that.  I'd recommend this item.

The case was very well made and sturdy. Unfortunatly it was too small for my sony 7 in DVD portable player. Returning it to amazon was quick and easy. I wish it would have fit.

I just recently bought a sub-woofer and I spent a good deal of time searching for an interconnect. The interconnects I looked at ranged from ridiculously over-priced to questionably cheap. I knew I wanted it to be THX certified and of a length that would allow me some freedom of sub-woofer placement. This interconnect provided both at a very reasonable price. I must say after installing my subwoofer that this cable was a perfect choice. 

Some might say that the cost reflects a cables ability to provide good sound. Wrong. This is just as good as those 70 dollar interconnects. I do buy monster cable for most of my home theatre needs, but I do not buy into some of the hype surrounding Monster cable and their more expensive cables. 

Why only 4 and not 5 stars. I did not like the way the cable was packaged. The cable was folded down the middle and now the center of the cable has a crook in it. I would have perfered it to be wound around a plastic spool to avoid folding of the cable. 

Getting past that, its a good interconnect that produces great sound.

This is actually the second RCDW500C I have purchased.  The first is still working, but it has so many miles on it that I wanted to have a back-up ready when it is time to be replaced.  Sony electronics, in my experience, are some of the toughest in the business.  The old unit may last a lot longer.  I am on my third Sony TV in the last thirty five years; the second is still working for the person I finally gave it to.

I am very comfortable with the technology of the RCDW500C.  Once learned, this unit is a dream to operate.  It is user friendly, displaying all of the info the user needs for optimum use.  If you have questioins, the manual is well written, and will usually enable the user to solve any problems.  Sony is a very reputable company.  In my humble opinion, Sony has been out in front of virtually all of their competitors for a long time.  Their products have always been a good investment for me.

This is a great product for your mini.  The armband is well-constructed from a neoprene-type material (which doesn't slip when you're sweaty) with heavy-duty velcro all the way around, and the ipod holder is securly screwed onto it.  The rubberized skin keeps your iPod safe from sweat and provides some shock and scratch resistance.

This isn't a super-cheap armband, but as they say, you (usually) get what you pay for.  This should last you for years of gymming / running / biking

I just received these and popped 'em in and I'm listening to MP3s on my PC.  At first, one of sides was really weak in volume.  In the process of testing the balance in my software, I accidentally cranked up the volume way to high for these guys, but that apparently did the trick.  Now both are equal, and sound good.  
There is decent bass, but the highs are a bit soft.  A quick tweak to my equalizer, and they're great.  After reading several of the reviews on Amazon, I was a bit worried about the sound, but now that I have them I'm very happy.  They're a good price, and sooooo much better than the little ipod-like earbuds I've tried before.  Those never stayed in my ear, and the bass never made me happy.  

Summary:
These Jbuds stay in my ear, have good sound (not great, but I think good for $20), and have equal length cords from each ear

 I have just started with an Apple ipod nano product and was not impressed with the factory included ear buds at all. They didn't sound real good and didn't come supplied with the ear bud pads in the box so they would just fall out of your ears. What's the deal with that? Next came the old Sony MDR 027 head phones from the closet. The Sony's have the old adjustable head bar so no more falling out of the ears now. They worked o.k., I guess, but in comparison these JBuds sound MUCH better than either of the previous ones. I'm now listening at half volume compared to about three quarters before and all sounds fine. I'm hearing parts of the music not audible before with the other two models. Crisper highs, great mid range, and responsive lows. Set up was fast too, just find the correct size ear bud pads out of the three different sized pairs supplied and your off and running. The JBuds actually stay in your ear. Wow what a concept. They are also very comfortable due to the fact I forgot they were in and started talking on the phone before noticing. The cord is just the right length for setting the ipod on a desk while still allowing plenty of movement or attaching it to a pocket. If you think you have a little too much just wrap some up with a bread tie. Better too much than not enough. So back to the closet with the Sony. 
 
 I guess what it all boils down to is you could do a whole lot worse than these especially for a mere twenty bucks. I couldn't have made a better choice for the money and quality. You should do the same. 

 Another quick note. The shipping went great. Not too long at all and with standard USPS. Thanks Amazon

Wonderful.  Holds all my songs, holds my books on tape so I can listen on the road.  Photos are large and sharp.  Very easy to use and easy to download. The dials are excelent, on-off and volume work flawlessly.  I have many products such as car adapter, speakers, external charger, and external microphone and all work great.  I highly recommend the unit.  I would never get less then 60 gigs, plenty of space for all of my needs.  On my recent trip to California this was the only thing I took for entertainment; never listened to a song twice

This is my second one of this model, I burned up the first myself when we moved and I accidentially plugged the wrong transformer into it (too much voltage = smoke).  I found it easy to configure, set up WEP keys, MAC locked everything using the web-based interface.  It worked great with our LinkSys Media extender - we watch recorded tv from our Media Center pc on our plasma screen tv three rooms away using this device.  No problems whatsoever.  Hasn't slowed down my internet connection either.  I am buying another one today to serve the mobile computer lab at work.

I've been in the newspaper business for many years, and I've always used recorders at governmental meetings, interviews, etc. -- much easier and faster than taking notes, and it allows me to focus more on my subject. Until now, I've never had a recorder that could pick up everything without a lot of background noise or without having to turn the tape over or replace it in the midst of the event. This little Sony is the perfect size, picks up everything without all that background noise and plays it back crystal clear. Additionally, it has a long battery life, and I never run out of room while I'm taping. I couldn't ask for more

Out of the box and into the attic.  Followed the instructions and I'm receiving perfect signals for my 46" SONY HDTV set from Pensacola, FL (approx 20 miles) and Mobile, AL (approx 50 miles).  I did read the instructions and followed them, I believe the folks that aren't happy with this model didn't read and follow the instructions

unlike most tech gadgets that are a little outdated, this product stands in nearly every aspect. The sleek, supreme design by F.A. Porsche makes this product appearance timeless, and its preformance is outstanding, more effective in this model than its smaller, slower (80Gb, 120 Gb) counterparts. The autostart is a little slow for me (its the USB model, not firewire, remeber), but is a totally acceptable feature for the price, design &amp; performance cost-benefit equilibrium. Excellent purchase

The GOOD: We plugged in our new LNS2651D on 3/7/7, about an hour northwest of Tampa Bay.  Right out of the box,with an old Rabbit Ear antenna, we received five HD broadcasts.  The picture is amazing in both color and clarity.  The BAD: We reset the sound coming directly from its speakers, but because of speaker location underneath/below the screen,it lacks sparkle, esp at low to med. volume. The UGLY:  Imagine sending your intelligent,pretty young daughter out on her first date, with shoveled-on make-up, and wearing a cheap black vinyl dress.  The "Piano Black" case on this tv is a nightmare!  It shows a rippled effect, which gets distracting and even more tacky when outside light shines (even lightly) on it.  I'm hoping after the R&amp;D department who designed the case, is sent to Siberia, they redeem themselves by designing a Matte Finish slip- cover for this otherwise excellent TV

Monster has always had the reputation to being the best in quality for their products... When you think of wires, you cannot help think of Monster Cable... I used this cable to connect my carputer to my factory head unit... Ran up the middle of the car, grouped with a VGA cable and multiple USB cables, there is no feedback at all.. i was worried the VGA feed may leak into this cable but monster did not let me down.. I highly recommend this product... but as others on here have stated.. little pricey... in the end 'you get what you pay for!

I've had a GE and a Sony (CD543RM) kitchen under counter units.  I've also tested a few others in stores.  The Sony 543 model is superior to any other unit out their and the Sony 553 is superior to the Sony 543.  The 553 is worth the extra bucks for the better sound quality and AM/FM reception.

I originally bought my daughter an iLive IBCD3816DT boombox for her birthday. The hiss was unbearable, so I took it back and purchased this product. Much better quality control and it docks perfectly with her 2GB ipod nano using the supplied insert. Very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone. It sounds great, looks good, and the controls are very intuitive.

This is perfect (so far) and exactly what I needed.  I have been looking for a new keyboard to work with my desktop, which sits right next to mu Polycom Conference Phone.  I have been looking for something that was silent and took up less desktop space.  I work out of a home office when I am not on the road so I need something that works.  I spend a lot of time on the phone, so I want to be able to type without everyone on the call knowing it.  Perfect.  Setup took about 15 minutes with absolutely no hitches and no issues - the first time that has happened for me with a LogiTech prouct.  I had read these reviews and was prepared for a grueling install, but instead it happened so quickly I was right back to work fully functional.

I use my HP Media Center as the base PC for my office and printers - the workhouse of my office, but I have a ThinkPad X60 Tablet in a docking station.  I connect from the Media Center to the ThinkPad using remote computing and it works like a champ new keyboard, mouse, keypad and all.

This is a great keyboard, mouse, and numeric keypad combination.  We will see how long the batteries last, but so far so good. A+

I made the mistake to buy the Kensington laser pointer before this one. The Kensington is a good one, very well made, but it is slightly more expensive and lacks the mouse control. I to not know any cheaper model with mouse function. I can maybe prefer a bit the ergonomy of the Kensington, together with the very practical possibility to store the USB receiver inside the unit, but this is probably just my taste and the hiro is quite comfortable either and lighter. My kensington has the embarrassing feature that the laser pointer is interpreted as RETURN on some applications (Exporer on Windows and Opera on Mac OS, for instance). I do not know it that is a bug or if there is some reason for that. However the Hiro does not have this behaviour and that is another reason for which I prefer it.

The wheel system of the Hiro presenter is very practical. Compared with my Kensington I found no difference in the quality of the laser: both do their job perfectly. The mouse control is simple and practlical and it will take a very short time to be confident with it. My unit worked perfectly wothout extra software on both Mac an PC. Overall I am extremely satisfied. 

On the minus side, the labels on the button on the side are printed with very poor colours. the "fn" label diapperared immediately after a few days of usage. A bit disappointing, but, after all, nothing really important. The unit also lacks programmable buttons, but I do not know any presenter with this feature. 

Bottomline. This presenter works well, it is not expensive, and the mouse control is a true must

All of the PC to Stereo cbales I could find in the stores were only 6ft long.  Due to the furniture arrangement in my living room, I needed a longer cable to make the connection.  I was also worried about loss of sound quality over long distances.  The 20 ft Monster Cable took care of both those issues for me. The connections are solid and the sound quality is great.  It was well worth the money

I bought this mouse about three months ago, and I love it.  It works on every surface, and the scroller works well too.  The only complaint I have is that the cord is rather short (about 2.5 feet long), and it plugs into the left-hand side of my laptop, which means that I only have about a foot to work with.  Although, I think that complaint can be shared equally with the Dell people for putting the USB port on the left (good deal for the left-handed population, I guess).  Some people have complained about the wind-up function for the cord getting tangled, but I haven't had any problems with that

These phones are great.  Sound quality is very good, including the speaker phone option.  Phones have many handy features, and all features are intuitive to use.  No problem with the range.  Very easy to set up.  Battery life has proven to be no concern so far.  The phones feel comfortable in the hand.  I couldn't be happier

After installing the card, I booted up my Windows XP and it locked up.  After rebooting again, however, the card worked fine and has continued to work fine.

I've only had the card for two days, and so far I am very happy with it. Here's my setup: Windows XP Home Edition, Direct TV set-top box, and a standard cable from the set-top box into the card.  Since the set-top box is in the other room, I'm just using the set-top box remote to set it on the right channel.  A little tedious, but it's fine for recording a few shows.  I haven't tried the remote that came with the card (I assume it doesn't work through walls).

The WinTV 2000 software is not very user friendly, but I haven't found any bugs in it yet.

I chose not to install the software and drivers from the CD.  Instead, I downloaded all of the latest versions directly from the manufacturer's web site

We got this phone about 3 years ago.  In the past month, the buttons have begun to be an issue.  You can press and press a button and maybe on the 3rd try, it works.  Finally go another phone.  As with all things today, it isn't made to last.  However, the price makes it less painful to have to buy another so soon

It installs easily and with the blue led allows you to see if power is still connected.  Highly recommended

I use this with a PC running on Windows XP Home Edition SP2 and it works marvels. Damn, I didn't even need to install the drivers that came with it. I just grabbed the USB cable, plugged it in and started making sequences on Sonar 4.

No latency, nothing.

I recommend this product for both PC and Mac users

When I first got a wireless network at home I purchased a Kensington WIFI Finder.  It worked fine.  But as time went on I saw these smaller versions come out from Chrysalis Development.  I heard they were more powerful and more versatile.  So I bought one.  I was NOT disappointed.  Since it was about the same size as my keyless entry remote for my car, it fit perfectly on my keychain.  Also it has a much longer range than the others.  But best of all, it is directional.  Meaning I can simply turn my body while holding down the button and the LEDs change instantly as the signal strength increases or decreases.  What a great product. I Love it!

With all the reviews about how easy the Nano scratches, I left the protective film on until I found the right case the next day at CC (they had just received them that day), sorry Amazon but the Nano did come from you.  Anyway the case is certainly up to the standard of the Nano itself.  It comes with a peel off protective strip that fits over the screen itself.  I have noticed the click wheel was a little slow to respond with the shipping film on it, but since when this case is open the click wheel is directly accessible, it works great.  It fits snugly in this case, yet is easy to remove though removal is not necessary to charge or update. The case has a felt inner lining which seems protect it and may provide some shock protection in case of falls. I have used it daily for 2 weeks with no scratches at all.  The belt clip is sturdy and secure.  The magnetic snap for closing it works great. The case can be closed with headphones attached, but of course to make adjustments it has to be opened which is easily done while on the belt clip as it unfolds to allow easy access. This case is as cool as the Nano itself and I would very highly recommend it. I hope Belkin makes the same case for the new IPOD

The best sound I've ever heard in a radio. I also own a Cambridge Soundworks 730 and a Bose Wave CD/Radio.
Despite the fact that this is a mono radio, its sound is incredible accurate, warm and powerful. The bass is astounding and the highs crystal clear.
I agree with a report I've read in CNET that states this is probably the best sounding radio ever made.

This was my first GPS system of any kind.  I wasn't sure what to expect.  I have a small Mazda Miata so I wanted a small-screen GPS that did not overwhelm my small dashboard and this did not disappoint.  I was afraid that the screen would be too small, but it's perfect.  I don't think a bigger screen would do anything more than take up more space. 
I live in New York City and before putting it in my car I walked with the GPS unit in my hands.  Perhaps because of the tall buildings and the slow walking speed it took more than 30 minutes for it to initially receive a satellite signal.  I was convinced it was defective.  It's not.  Once I put  it on the dash of my car and began driving it acquired a satellite signal within a few minutes.
This unit comes with a 128Mb Micro SDcard onto which you can load a few state maps at one time.  I ordered a 1Gb Micro SDcard along with this GPS (for approx. $11 on Amazon) and loaded ALL of North America at one time. This eliminates the need to re-load maps when traveling anywhere in the country. It's worth the extra effort. This unit can be quickly moved from one car to another, especially a rental car anywhere in North America.  
My very first test of this thing was on the very complicated underpasses and overpasses in northern Manhattan and the Bronx.  It was flawless!  It's impossible to get lost with this thing.  Occasionally I've made a turn too early or too late and within seconds it will re-calculate the best route.  The combination of the voice prompts, the highlighted route you need to go, and the current and next street(s) at the top are excellent. Also, the estimated arrival time in the lower left is nice, but does not account for traffic jams.  The arrival time will just keep getting pushed back the slower you travel.  It's kind of a "best traffic scenario" prediction.
This is so easy to use I'm thinking of buying one for my 68-year-old mother who doesn't have a clue when it comes to technology, but I'm convinced she could use this without a problem (once I've loaded the maps for her.)
If not having bluetooth and all the other latest bells and whistles on a GPS system doesn't bother you (as it doesn't bother me) buy this, you won't be sorry!

If your a serious gamer and want the best quality money can buy, like me, I would highly suggest this product. Sounds are crystal clear, and fiber optics is the next step up in technology. My first question for you would be, "how much do you invest in your gaming?". Once again, if your like me the answer is a lot. My next question would be "how important is your audio experience?" YOu dont know what your missing out on until you actually experience the difference. Very happy with this product

My high school is making us buy these calculators, and I want to say it is definately worth the price!  This thing works wonders, and it will do ANYTHING Math-realated that you want to do!!!!!!  I would strongly encourage you to buy this calculator.  It also comes with a great unit converter and the periodic table, so it's great for students like myself to use.  BUY THIS CALCULATOR!!!!!  You can also hook it up to your computer through a USB cable, so you can view your screen that is on the calculator, on your computer monitor, and you can back up and restore your RAM memory

Great item.  Picture great, sound great, connection choices great.
One problem:  Being located about a foot away from an under-cabinet radio, the presence (shut off) of this TV produces an annoying ratteling sound in the radio.  To eliminate this sound you must unplug this TV from the power source! Or, optionally, move it at least three feet away, which in our case is not practical.
Very curious!

The EyeTV 2.x software is a bit rough around the edges (compared to Dish DVR and Tivo), but it's very usable and works great.  I bought this so I can watch the Maryland Terrapins at work (CBS MMOD blacks out local games) and it's great to be able to infinitely adjust the video window.  You can record the program and watch it at lunch or when you get a chance.  

You will need a good antenna and I wish they provided one like Miglia.  But guess what, you can buy the Miglia magnetic antenna and it works better than many larger antennas from Radio Shack or Target.  The Miglia antenna comes apart and can go with you on travel.  Imagine watching local HDTV on the road without having to use the hotel cable.

[...]

Product Description:  Portable ATSC antenna for TVMini HD. This antenna is not suitable for analog products such as TVMicro and TVMax.

It works with the Hybrid very nicely and only costs $15 US.  It took 4 weeks to arrive, but it's worth it and works much better than the two arial with loop antenna I got for 2x as much

Radio Shack wanted $39.95 for a similar item so at $9.95 this was a steal - swr is good and performance is as much as I need for Corvette runs although it hears well and gives a good transmit signal for the small size far beyond what I need.  I did have to put a metal plate on the Vette (discreetly) as it wouldn't stick to the fiberglass.  Good produc

I have a 40" Samsung LCD and wanted an arm that would both extend and also be able to hold 50 lbs or so.  This arm feels solid and does the job; the tv hasn't fallen yet.  One thing to be sure of is to check the size adapter plate you will need to connect the arm to your tv.  My arm came with a 200 x 100, but I needed a 200 x 200 plate and had to order it separately.  I would recommend this arm

I did a bit of internet research for this, and a site devoted to luggage was RAVING about this. What can I say? They were right, and it is just an unbelievable value. I love it. 

I got it because I do alot of walking for my commute, had started a class that required me to do alot more to get there and the book was massive. My back was already complaining about what I was carrying around on a daily basis. I ordered it and it arrived in 2 days, My back was and is so grateful.

It is tough! the sidewalks aren't in the best shape, and I'm always pulling it up and down over curbs and had a couple of days of ice and snow, and the wheels are scuffed up but still no worse for wear (although the little pad on the bottom for cushioning your hip if you wear it over your shoulder fell off, but why would I want to carry it like that anyway). Very well designed, with plenty of compartments, and padded computer sleeve is removeable. It maneuvers well, is light with a comfortable handle and strap (gel-like). I can grab it by the handle and walk up the metro stairs with no problem.

A quality case for a great price

I bought this bag as a replacement for another roller bag for my 17" laptop and was surprised at how compact the design is and how weight conscious it is.  The storage capacity and location for such things as chargers and cords in the space where the roller frame is makes this thinner than my previous bag.  I also appreciate the smaller zippered pocket on top for things like plane tickets and things that you need quick access to.  As an engineer, I must say the design is well worth the price and certainly is a practical way to carry a larger laptop

I use Print Works CD/DVD envelopes and was worried when I ordered this product that the envelopes wouldn't fit top-up which is important for me because I label the tops of my envelops to make looking through them easier. The envelopes are just a hair over 5" wide and they fit into these storage boxes perfectly. There is just enough room on either side to make flipping through the dvds easy. I ordered four of these and am glad I did. I keep them on a shelf side-by-seide and the make a perfect card-catalog-type filing systemfor all my dvds. I will most definately be ordering up more of these when I need more room; these boxes are great. If you use a 5" wide envelope, rest assured that these boxes are just the right size to fit all your dvds.

Ordered 2 items...Ideastream CD Storage Boxes and Fellows CD Sleeves. which is obviously 2 different manufacturers. When ordering, I clicked on a combination option to order both. Needed 10 of each...the "10" only tranferred to 1 item, not both.  Was not noticed until transaction completed and received a verification.  Called customer service and found out there were two "customer Services" to deal with.  Could not change the order even though it was less than 5 minutes when I first called.   Customer Service is obviouly not in the US...had a communication problem and could not get a "supervisor" as no one was available for 2 hours.   ended up paying for 2 freight charges because we had to place a 2nd order to get the quantity needed.   Could not get any help...will look elsewhere before we place another order of that type.

Items were exactly what was needed.    Amazon Customer Service was non-existant

I agree with the prior review of these JBL E10s, however I'd go to the E20s for a small room main stereo set--better bass worth the slight price increase.  Bought for rear channel (RC) use, I find the E10s quite "airy", with what seems like a better high frequency response than the main E30s I just bought from A'.com (see my 5 Star review), giving extremely open and detailed "surround" RC performance.  

NOTE: The specs listed on A'.com for the E10s state "Bi-wireable: Yes" BUT...unless JBL has just changed the terminals to do this that's wrong--mine have just a single terminal set, and DON'T BOTHER with the pricey speaker mounts offered as accessories (unless you plan ceiling installs) as they come with two "slide down" screw slots attached to the back for wall installation.  

Surfing for the BEST PRICE, I bought mine refurbished from [...] for a LOW $53.00 bid plus $18.00 S+H directly from JBL and you may find the E30s/E20s from JBL as refurbs there as well.

As RC speakers--ESPECIALLY at the price I got them--I recommend them highly, well deserving the 5 Star rating given

I had a 1st generation shuffle and upgraded to a 60gb video which I adore! However, I found that whenever I went running I was stealing my old shuffle back from my daughter.  I bought this shuffle for my husband and fell in instant love with it.  I really like how portable it is and you can't beat being able to just clip it onto your clothing.  No arm straps, no more lanyards.  So now I have the 60 gig for my entire library of music and videos and the shuffle for exercise

The mouse itself is very nicely designed and cool looking. I use it with my Apple Mac G5. The optical tracking is great, no moving parts. The scroll wheel is indispensable for browsing the web and scrolling through documents. I just wish the software that comes with it would be more stable, less buggy. I had to uninstall it and use another mouse driver with more options, functions and less bugs

My mom bought me the candlestick phone and it is great. My friends love it, too. It looks really cool and the ringtone it just like my grandmas old phone. I can hear everybody really clear and they have no problem hearing me. I am very happy with this phone

I got mine for about 1 week ago to match with my MBP (silver theme). Someone mentioned about the light indications not showing as they should, or in the wrong way but mine works fine.

CONS:
- light indicator shows exactly which USB ports are in use. 
- Small in size
- Has USB port on top which comes in handy.
- Enough USB power- so far I didn't have to plug in the power charger yet. 
- Comes with a USB plugged light. 
- Comes with a extended USB cable (for you to connect the hub to your computer)
- the USB plug is silver + transparent in color which looks kinda nice.


PRONS:
- it camed with some minor scratches on the hub's surface although I just took it out from its sealed package carefully. Those surface scratches aren't too noticeable. (Didn't want to return it and waste time &amp; money). 
- as many have already mentioned, the USB cable is connected to the hub permanently. 


Other thoughts:
- The USB cable connected the the hub is pretty thin. It'd be a good feature (look less noticeable) f you treat the cable nicely, but if you are harsh on the cable, it feels like it may break. Will be GREAT if this hub has firewire ports, but I'm very happy with this item

I've owned this pocket pc for a week now with very little problems.  I don't know anything about an upgrade but so far I haven't had any major problems with it.  When I left it in the car and then came home it wouldn't turn on.  I noticed it was very warm but as soon as I did a soft reset the device turned on.  The soft reset doesn't make you lose all your data.  I just had to reset the date.  I've had to do this a couple of times so far.  

 I did purchase a 2 gig sd card and have lots of room.  I recommend that you shop around for the 2 gig memory card however because I bought mine from amazon and then I found it cheaper at best buy.

I am really happy with this product. I love the way it looks.  It's easy to figure out and I'm not really savvy with electronic gadgets.  I did sign up for hotmail so I could use the msn features.  It was easy to sync my music to the device and the download is done automatically with the sync.  The music sounds great with a great pair of headphones. I use the calendar which helps to remind of events and appointments.  Also use the task button which reminds of stuff that needs to be done.  Great for the highly stressed out who tend to forget things. There is also a feature to write a note in your own handwriting and then the device turns it into typewritten words.  Really neat!

I use the recording device to record my class lecture and it's a little hard to hear but there is a lot of noise in the classroom and I sit in the back and the teacher is up at the front.  But the important thing is that I could understand what was being said so i could transcribe it.  As a nursing student I was able to purchase and download nursing programs from a website with no problems and they run great.

I just can't believe all the features that come with this pocket pc.  I have no regrets making this purchase.  I look forward to reading more reviews on this product and learning everything it can do.  So far it's been fun

An outstanding platform for Windows mobile operating system.  Flawless syncing with home/office desktop.  Clear, high resolution screen is a joy compared to my previous Palm based PDA's.  Wireless functioning is reliable and seamless.  Ergonomics are excellent.  Good to above average batery life with power saver options.  Would highly recommend this product

When it comes to ink for my R1800 photo printer, I am concerned with the quality of the images I print. The Epson matte black UltraChrome Hi-Gloss ink cartridge provides superior resistance to water, fading and smudging. It is important to me that my prints are of high quality, so I don't attempt to use the cheaper compatible ink cartridges. The color can be duplicated, but all inks are not created equal.  Third party options may produce a good print initially, but may not hold up or last as long.

PROS:
Provides superior resistance to water, fading and smudging

CONS:

This is the correct ink for my printer.  I do not buy lower priced substitutes.  It was great to find this on Amazon at a good price and eligible for free shipping.  I only wish Amazon stocked the complete set of inks for this printer which I purchased from them.

It's a good phone, works well. I like the Caller ID &amp; Function buttons being a different color than from the rest of the phone, makes them easier to see &amp; use. It has good sound &amp; a ring tone that doesn't jangle the nerves.
The only problem I had with it is that the cord goes directly into the phone &amp; one must use the cord that the phone comes with, rather than one already in use. I purchased an adapter so that I could plug it into an extension phone cord because we needed to put it some distance from the wall jack. Not a big deal in my book but one I didn't learn about until I got the phone.
Overall I am pleased with it

While these recorders are considered "old fashioned" by electronic geeks, they are very useful for those of us who just want to use the counters and go to specific areas of a tape.  Mine paid for itself in the first 5 minutes of a legal deposition when I jogged the momory of a forgetful witness with his own words on tape.  He still insisted he couldn't remember anything, but had to admit it was his voice and that he -- being the model of honesty and truth -- must have been trying to tell the truth when he spoke.  Very effective, these "old-fashioned" recorders.

After 8 months of thinking, "these (foam inserts that came with my E3c's)will last forever" I broke down and ordered these replacements as the originals were getting quite dirty.   Whoa!  The new ones made me realize how much my originals had hardened.  My great sound and comfort was back - and the decay was so gradual I didn't even realize what I was missing!

So, 5 stars for performance, but 3 stars for what amounts to some pretty expensive foam ear plugs.  Avg=4stars

This cable was just what I needed to connect my stereo to my computer's sound card across the room.  I've been converting old LPs to digital files, and having a well-built cable probably improved the sound quality considerably.  Amazon's price was unbeatable too

Opened the enclosure, plugged in my hard drive, connected it to my PC, and it worked. Simple as that.

I spent a whole 10 seconds realizing that the instructions provided showed that I had to remove a single screw from the back panel when I really had to remove two screws, but that was the only (very minor) problem.

There is no fan in the case, which means the only noise is from the hard drive itself. I am assuming the case itself acts as a large heatsink, but I havent yet monitered temperatures on the hard drive itself.

I am pleased with the enclosure, and would happily recomend it to anyone

We bought this to use with our WS-300M to record a class. We thought the stereo would result in a better quality recording. In the end, we set the recorder to MONO (HQ) because the speaker moves his head and the sound travels from one channel to the other! Good quality but distracting. Save your money and buy the mono mic. The quality is excellent in either setting.
Buy the way, in case you miss it, this mic does come with a cable to connect it to the recorder

I purchased this GPS back in April of 2006 and have been very happy with it since.  It is not perfect, but you have to remember that this is not a dedicated street navigator or hicker GPS, it's a hybrid of the two and with that there are compromises.

In the car:  It is accurate and maps routes quickly 90% of the time.  The other 10% of the time it either looses signal, has outdated maps (my update is ordered and on it's way as I type), or just slow processing for some reason.  Of this 10% of the time I'd say only 2% of the time has this been an actual problem for me.  The rest of the time I was able to simply guess what I needed to do next or it didn't matter at all.  I have not found a perfect way of fixing the slow route calcuations, but the vast majority of the time this hasn't been an issue.

On foot:  One of the features that sold me on this was the fact that it had a long lasting battery and it was waterproof.  Both qualities needed to be used for hiking.  The only catch is you have to turn off the lock to roads, otherwise you will get some really confusing directions!  Also it is difficult to program in destinations by coordinates as opposed to addresses, but it can be done (put in and address then change everything including the coordinates in the confirmation screen before hitting route!).

On Boat:  Haven't tested this as I don't have a boat, and haven't purchased the water based maps.

Overall I'm very happy with this and looking forward to the map update.  I wish it was a little faster on route calculating and map drawing, and that it was easier to imput exact coordinate points.  It's still better than buying/lugging around 2 seperate GPS systems to me

I received my package within three days via the Super Saver Shipping (cost me nothing). The printer is great, too. I used the Brother 1440 series before and now upgraded to HP and I'm impressed. The printer shoots out the first page immediately without having to warm up, and its very light weight and small size making it more portable. I love it

Bought this Mp3 player for my girlfriend for christmas. She loves it. It is small and easy to use. The headphones could be better though. The process of puting songs onto the player is simple and fast. Considering you cannot hear the music without headphones...and the headphones that come with it are not very good, it only gets a 4 out of 5

I recently bought one of these babies for my niece seeing that she loves music but I was unwilling to pay an arm and a leg. It was a reasonable price and offers just what it delivers. She seems to really enjoy and found it to be easy to load both music and documents. The only real problem that I had with is that it costed less a few days after I purchased it. But that's really a personal problem

I own one in each color for my multiple pair of earbuds. I have to say that the only way to improve upon this product, other than offering more color combinations, would be to make it bulletproof, which it damn near is already. A wonderfully convenient and stylish accessory. Although $15 might come across as steep for such a small product, the cost becomes easier to justify as you begin purchasing more expensive earbuds. The $100+ Shure earphones are a sizable investment and must be protected. The Sendstation Earbuddy meets that demand better than any other product in it's category

I've had two RM-EZ2 for over a year now (on different TVs) ... very satisfactory indeed.

pro:
-very smooth action, easy to press buttons, fine for big clumsy fingers and poor eyesight
-always works without fussy pointing
-good battery life

con:
-eventually one will accidentally depress the wrong CBL or TV button and wonder why the remote no longer works ...
the cure is simple, just depress the correct button, but if you forget that they are there, you might think the remote is broken - it's not, it's you.
-There seems to be no way to generate the code to put your TV into setup mode - so don't throw away the manufacturer's original remote if you ever want to put the TV into setup mode

  Great portability, Good picture for the price. I like the fact that I can plug this player into any TV and play DVD's and also take it in the car, camping or anywhere. I also purchased a small set of external speakers which will really improve the sound. Onboard speakers a little lacking but overall a great value

This is extremely high quality photo paper best used in Canon photo printers.  The 13" by 19" is used best with the Canon I9000 printer series, with a web of 13".  This paper resists moisture damage and has archival quality.

I have owned this for about a week and wanted to share some initial thoughts.  All in all pretty pleased with the purchase.  It was well packaged and worked flawlessly with my iPod Mini.  There are five additional templates that can be used to dock different models.  Panicked at first because they didn't have one for the Mini, but it was already installed on the model.  Cons:

- Light dimmer has three settings, but even the lowest is too bright.  You can turn it off and it can be controlled by the remote.
- No ability to set a permanent alarm by day of week.  For example 7:00AM Monday to Friday, no alarm on Weekends.
- Wake to music starts and accelerates to the preset (by you) volume in something like 7 seconds so it is definitely not gentle.
- Sound is great for an alarm clock.  Don't think it will compare with a mini stereo or Bose SoundDock.  

Would buy again at the price

 The first ipod clock radio I bought was an Emerson iTone that was very disappointing. After returning it, I did a bunch of research, and decided to order the i177 (white). I am very happy with the unit. The sound is great. While it is not a Bose, it sounds way better than your average alarm clock. The controls are very intuitive and simple to use. I have a 4th generation ipod, and it fit perfectly. Another great feature is the display dimmer. You can turn the backlight completely off, a feature not found in many other products. A common complaint I read about for other brands of radio was that the display would light up the room! Not a problem with this unit. the remote control is pretty neat too. I like the fact that I can control my ipod remotely. There are 2 separate alarms, which is nice if your significant other has to get up at a different time. The only lacking feature is the ability to store radio stations. This would be nice, but I bought this unit to wake to my ipod so I can't complain. Overall this thing is great.

Since there is now relatively few choices for a good corded phone (esp. with caller ID), this phone is tops. This phone and all other AT&amp;T phones corded or cordless, exhibit slight feedback when talking loud or when hanging up.  But no other phone out there seems to be nearly as durable.  Given the other choices, this is the one to get

I bought this device to mount on the wall in front of my work desk, and for that purpose it's an admirable phone.

Plus: The contrast- adjustable LCD displays current date and time without you having to set it, the buttons for call list browsing, option setting, etc. are on the back of the receiver so you don't have to take the phone off the hook to use them. The sound quality is great of course, this being a corded phone, and it feels somewhat worthy in your hand. The keypad lights up, although only for a few seconds - dial fast in the dark! The ring tone is nice at its medium setting.

Minus: I find the base a bit bulky, the LCD has no background light, and when the handset is set to "hi" volume, you do hear a bit of a screeching noise when putting the set down on the base (I keep the setting at "lo" though, which is plenty loud). My main gripe is that the phone doesn't have a voicemail indicator, which would be extremely sweet with my phone company (Vonage). Also, the caller id stuff works with batteries ONLY - at least, they could have put a 6v ac adapter plug on the phone.

Still, four stars because the phone does all it says it does

I checked previous reviews before purchasing this notebook case. What I received is what I expected. Lots of compartments to store needed accessories, sturdy construction, pleasant appearance. As with a previous review, my only citicism is the shoulder strap. While it is comfortable when used, it is also fixed and cannot be removed. I've already caught it once on an airline seat arm when boarding a crowded plane. Other than that, it was a good purchase for the price

This monitor is an awesome buy.  I had no problems with my monitor, dead pixel-wise.

The only complaints I have to add are those that others have already voiced.  The stand does not securely fasten to the monitor, it just sort of sits there... a good push and down she may go.  The menu buttons on the right side aren't confusing to use, my other monitors have used a similar setup: Menu activates menu and also activates a menu item, up/down change values, menu backs out and there is a menu item to exit.  If I had put two of these monitors side by side, I can see how accessing the power button of the monitor on the left would be an issue, minor but perhaps irksome.

I have not tested the speakers, but seriously a good set of speakers won't set you back much, that's not what this monitor is for.  I would definitely buy another one in a heartbeat, if I didn't already have three monitors to begin with

They don't collapse, so they aren't the most easily portable as you sure aren't putting them in your pocket.  You also aren't listening to music in bed with them, as mentioned in other reviews, the back is not adjustable and will push the vertical facing speakers out of your ears.

I tend to collect lower end headphones, and why not.  So, I do have a unique perspective on them (or so I say, mostly to flatter myself).

These, compared to other vertical designs, are good.  The sound is better than most.  Not quite as good as the Sony h.EAR line, but those would never stay in my ears and when dangling they are literally tangle hooks.  These p9's are simple, one piece, and very smartly the cord only comes up to one ear.

The volume adjustment makes them nice for Tv and computer use.  Also, if you ever listen while using a splitter, make sure the other person is wearing the cans (or whatever more power consumptiony headphones) so you can cut your volume.  My wife wears cans when watching TV, so when I just MUST watch some witty Sonic commercial, I just plug myself in.

They aren't perfect.  I'd like to also try the Sennheiser vertical over the head cheapos as well as the Sony folding ones.  They did come in very handy when my scroll wheel on my Rio Carbon was broken (only volume control on the thing).  

For reference, my everyday buds are Sony ED21LPs, which I highly reccomend for all purpose use as they wont fall out, and can be stored in a very small area.  Heck, I even use the stupid pouch that comes with them.

But, yeah, knowing the weaknesses of the p9, if you think you'd like it, then you'll love it

This mount is perfect!  It sticks well to the windshield,keeps the GPS rock steady. It allows you to swing to Driver, Center and Passenger's views and back without any bending or remounting.

I am very pleased!  My roadmate looks a 100% better on this mount. I hated the mount that came with the GPS.

The build quality of this mount also seems to be very good.

I would highly recomend this mount

In spite of some of the poor reviews for this product, it met all of my expectations 100%. Thanks to the reviews, I understood that the unit doesn't have a builtin antenna or batteries, which was helpful to know in advance. But of course the specifications never claimed those features in the first place.

I was looking for a small TV to fit in the corner of my bathroom, and this unit is perfect for that. As a bonus, I can not only watch the news while I'm getting ready for work in the morning, but I can listen to MP3 rips when I'm in the shower. I've owned the unit for several weeks now, use it every day, and have never had a problem playing any disk, either copy-protected movies or CDs. My only concern so far has been that I didn't receive a warrantee card with the unit.

I especially like the portability. It's so easy to pick up and take anywhere, such as watching a movie in bed, and even outside (if it's not too bright out) for watching sports on the patio. The speakers are adequate, considering their size, and the headphone jack lets me either use headphones or external amplified speakers if I want better quality.

In summary, I have to repeat that my expectations were set before I bought the unit and I am very pleased with what I got for the price

At around $35. these UltraEars are a amazing deal. They have great base, mids, and highs. The seperation is good too. If you tweek your mp3's sound you can realy dial them in. Push them nice and tight in to your ear to get the best sound.

I bought the cooler for my Dell Inspiron which tends to get hot because I work it so hard - it's cut down the time the internal fan kicks in drastically, is very sturdy yet light enough for me.
So I bought another (wide-screen)(black) version for my HP Pavilion which has more RAM and so doesn't have to work that hard, now its internal fan virtually never kicks in.  
In both cases the fan is so quiet that I have to turn it on/off to make sure that it is working.
The only improvement I would suggest is more usb ports.
4 stars because 5 is perfection

This is an amazing little device. I carry every Word and Excel file I have created in the last year on this device. How remarkable is that? Kingston really had a better profile than other thumb drives. I still have my clip cap after several months. I carry it with me daily. 

The really powerful potential for these devices is yet to be realised but I'm thinking about them! Let me know how you are using yours.

In addition to my data files, I downloaded applications giving my flash drive the power to accomplish tasks on its own. Overall, I am happy with my drive and believe as you think of new ways to employ one you will be too. I give this device a big thumb's up

I am using batteries and really enjoy the freedom of movement, i.e. not needing to worry about plugging it into a power source. It's an excellent choice for my situation

I purchased the Casio keyboard for my Grand-daughter's 4th birthday.  She really enjoyed playing it.  As a matter of fact she was still interested in it the next day.  It is the perfect size for a small child.  She sits in her recliner and has the keyboard across the arms.  The only thing that wasn't perfect is that you can mute what the child is playing, but not the 10 songs that are prerecorded in it

I enjoy this mouse. Usually, I don't like using the touch pad on laptops but after deciding to buy a mouse, I had to look for a specific mouse that would fit into my lifestyle as a student. I have small hands and I hate carrying out heavy objects in my bookbag. Since I have to lug my laptop around, I needed a mouse that didn't take a lot of space, is good enough to withstand constant shifting in my laptop, and that worked well with my needs.

Pros: Small size, optical, scrolling tab, and portability
Cons: Sometimes the mouse jumps around a bit on its own. BUT this happens only a few times every few weeks - so it's not often enough to cause a problem for me.

Enjoy

I just bought my first laptop computer and really, really hated the touchpad. I found it unresponsive at times and found the whole right clicking and using the pad at the same time a pain.

I spent a while browsing the different mice available on this and other sites and in the end decided upon this little number.

I am very happy that I did too. Its pretty small and very lightweight but at the same time it doesnt feel at all fragile - definately well made. Im about 5'11 and have fairly big hands - I find this mouse comfortable to use. It looks pretty cool too, the red panels on the side light up, which is always good for night work. All the buttons are very responsive and that middle button is a godsend after using the touchpad for the past month. I couldnt ask for better all round performance. And for $20 you really cant go wrong, it really is a great price for a microsoft mouse. The only reason I dont give it five stars?? Well this is technology - although it is a awesome piece of kit, there are always other things or features they could have added

This router has worked great for the past year.  We have 3 Linux computers connected to DSL through it.

One PC is at the far end of the house.  We use two Novatech Powerline Ethernet Adapters to connect that PC to the Netgear router through our home powerline wiring.  Netgear and Novatech work fine together, with no DSL speed degredation.

The browser interface is easy to use.  The firewall features are easy enough for the inexpert user to understand.

The manual is good, but I would prefer to have a hard copy

This PNY 2.0GB card has proven to be plenty as a digital camera card.  We purchased the 2 gig card for my wife's Canon Powershot S-900 "Elph" to replace smaller memory cards.  

Although 1GB cards worked adequately with the "Elph" we noticed, early on, that its 10.0 mega pixels quickly filled up the photo card.  The 2.0GB holds many more photos (over 400 shots and counting) than the 1GB.  At half the price of other brands, the PNY is proving to be very satisfactory (we purchased two 2.0s at once).

We happily recommend the PNY 2.0GB photo card for your photos.  It makes a great gift candidate.  Get yours soon!

Don't let the size fool you - I don't know much about audio - yet - but I can tell you the sound recorded from this mic is WAYYYY better than the USB Microphone Headset I was using. Much crisper with out all the fuzziness. And I didn't spend nearly as much as the Online Gurus were recommending. I am sure the $600 mic is great - but this is doing every thing I need.

Can't say enough good things about this Brother all-in-one, given its price and features.  (I paid $100 more than the new Amazon price elsewhere a week ago.)

I installed as a network device and set up the software on my XP Pro as well as Mac OS 10.4.9 machines ... easy installation, and the interface on each OS is essentially the same.  Super fast prints from either machine, crisp and beautiful, with tonal background fills printing which never showed up on my previous HP laser.

Duplex scan/fax as well as duplex print was the key to my purchase, and I've been really happy.  What I did not anticipate was just how fast the printer is, or how rich the delivered software is compared with prior HP experience.

Noises don't seem unusual to me - no crackling here, just noisy paper handling by ADF and print engine.  No big deal IMHO.

Only a few minor negatives I've seen so far:  (1) it looks like the firmware can only be updated from a Windows computer, so Mac folks are stuck there (mine was delivered with current version of firmware, so maybe this doesn't matter), (2) you cannot feed heavy stock through it, even the manual feed tray - so need to keep a straight feed device around if you need thicker than 24# stock, (3) scanner transfer rate to computer is a bit slow - not sure if it is the network interface or a slow processor in the device, and (4) expansion memory is not a popular size, so is more expensive than current PC memory - not sure if I'll upgrade or not.

Haven't tried envelopes yet, so can't respond to earlier comments from others.

It's kind of entertaining to watch the machine do a duplex copy - as pages in the ADF suck in and out to scan both sides, and pages ejecting come partway out and suck back in to copy the back side

I have had this tv since the weekend before the Superbowl. The Superbowl and any Nascar race looks incredible. Many reviews I read(everyone on here)which had totaled around 109. Whew! I gotta tell ya though, this tv replaced a 51" Sony HDTV. The sound was awesome. When I turned on this new Samsung I was VERY disappointed. My wife almost made me send it back because of it. I made some adjustments which did make it sound a little better but nowhere near the Sony. I went to a big box store and they told me it was because these companies expect that you will hook it up through a surround system and not use the TV sound. {shrug} I do for movies but not for regular tv.
Overall it is a very nice tv especially for the $$

Compared to my logitech mouseman dual optical from 2000, this mouse blows it away by far in accuracy, precision.  What I find to be a drawback is the mouse's light weight and small size.  The size comes in handy if I need to flick, but be sure to keep the wire out of the way - as the mouse is so light if you have the wire in a bad spot, it will push the mouse and affect your aim at crucial moments. The "change sensitivity" button is in a strange spot (at least if u have large hands) located in the center of the mouse where you will need to reach far back and almost touch the pad of your palm of the finger you're reaching with - not an efficient movement, therefore not applicable in games (you can assign a sensitivity script to perhaps one of the side mouse buttons if necessary).  These are only minor itches when compared to the outstanding precision and I would highly recommend it

I did my research before purchasing this wireless card from Amazon to use in conjunction with my Belkin Pre-N wireless router.  According to every net review I'd read, this combination of Belkin Pre-N desktop card and router had the best range and throughput at that range than any other card/router in its class, and as my workstation is out in the middle of a farm an almost impossible distance from the router, 'range' is what I needed above all.

After some configuration and finding the best spot to put the computer itself, I now regularly have connection qualities in the 77-90% range a good 200-300 ft. from my router which is in another building entirely (and both have a lot of metal cladding and what-not I had expected to cause a great deal of interference if not outright unworkability.)

The odd thing about this 'Pre-N' combination from Belkin is that apparently the later Belkin N equipment is grossly inferior, and manages to pull off only about half the range of this model.  

These cards and the Pre-N router are becoming harder to find as they've been superseded by the newer (inferior) models currently in the stores, so if you have to operate wireless at great distances, I doubt you'll beat these Belkin models for at least the immediate future

I recently bought one of these for our 18-month-old son.  The piano arrived in fine shape.  The piano and bench are sturdy and well made when you put them together properly.  The sound is just like I remember a toy piano should sound.  Notes are not perfectly in tune like a fine instrument, but tuned within reason to the notes of the scale, including sharps and flats.   Most importantly, our little boy just loves playing this piano.  Hopefully it will inspire him to continue and so it is as great an introdroduction to music as any other toy, including the electronic toys, we have purchased for him.  I also liked that he wasn't able to pull off the keys try as he may.  They just kind of become locked when he trys to do that and can be put back in place by minor adjstment.

When we initially pulled this out the box, I was excited becaue it was crafted so well!  Real wood and excellent craftsmanship - HOWEVER - the sound absolutely sucks!  It sounds like Elmo's toy piano, or even worse.  I thought it was just the fact that the piano was sitting flat on the floor (I hadn't installed the legs yet), and the sound was just off.  By the time I got everything assembled, the disappointment settled in even deeper. This piano was not worth the price I paid for it - by any stretch of the imagination.  I realize this is a TOY and not an instrument; but again, for the money, you'd expect a better sounding product.  An added note: my daughter LOVES banging on it

In my opinion, Sony's strength lies in its TVs.  This line of LCD sets are expensive, but you'll definitely get what you pay for.  The picture quality is incredible!  The beauty of this set is also material - it is a work of art.  While the internal speakers are decent, I would have been just as happy not to have them.  But thanks to the beautiful design of the bezel, you don't even know the speakers are there.

Some reviewers have mentioned "LCD clouding", and for a product of this price it would serve you well to do the appropriate Google search.  But Sony stands by its products, and if you receive a set that is not up to standards, they will rectify the situation.  Also, many reviewers are mentioning a lower-quality picture.  It is important to understand what kind of signal you are feeding the TV, and what signal will give you the optimal image.  Not all HD signals are the same, and will provide you with varying degrees of quality.  Be prepared to upgrade other equipment to explore the maximum potential of this device.  But, I have yet to see a signal that wasn't enhanced by being viewed on this set over my previous Panasonic tube set.

The interchangable bezels is a nice idea, but only for those with deep(er) pockets.  The silver set alone is beautiful, and if I had only one complaint, it would be that it's harder to get matching Sony peripherals in silver than you might think.  All in all, it's the best LCD you can buy

As the PS2 does not have HDMI outputs for High-Definition TV's, the Monster Cable GameLink 400 component cable is the next best thing and worth a few bucks more. You'd have to be retarded to not notice the difference between these component cables and standard (red, white, yellow) AV cables picture clarity. They are in two different worlds and Monster fully delivers. However, your TV must have component (red, blue, green) inputs for this cable to be useful.

Ensure that you have a fiber optic digital cable for your sound to go from your PS2 to your compatible tv/receiver. These cables are for picture only and do not have a sound cable. Therefore, you'll have to forget using the single plug-in the PS2 offers for both audio and video. However, your sound will be uncompressed, fully digital audio. This is definitely a plus, rather than a negative. Any mid-priced television or receiver built in the last six years will have a digital audio input

I don't understand the 1 star reviews, unless there is some product variability.  Price was $60 at Target.  Talk time is OK, although the longest I have been on the phone is maybe 10 or 15 minutes.  Range is fine.  Phone works all over the house, and audio quality if fine

These buds are definitely a step up from the standard iPod buds.  They stay in your ears much more easily (without the foam black covers, which are easily lost), the sound is at least marginally better, and the overall construction seems to be better.  You can't do much better for the money.

However, if you're willing to spend a little more, the JLab JBuds are the way to go.  I own both the Gumys and the JBuds, and the Gumys are my workout pair, and I use the JBuds for everything else.

But if you're looking to spend as little as possible yet still upgrade from the iPod buds, the Gumys are the way to go

Great GPS unit that does what is supposed to do and flawlessly at that. Clear easy to read display and instructions. Menus and interface are self-intuitive to the degree that you just turn it on and start using it. No downloads, activations or learning required. 

Satellite acquisition takes just a few seconds and recalculation when you miss a turn or instruction is equally fast. Accuracy is impressive with spot-on instructions and updated maps. Even small streets in rural areas are recognized and labeled. 

After looking at the Garmin and Magellan units I thought this was the best unit for the price. It has the largest screen and the most features for this price range. A previous reviewer complained about the misrepresentation of Bluetooth capabilities to which I completely disagree. The fact the Bluetooth features are available at this price range is already impressive. Also unless you buy a much pricier unit none of them come with a dashboard stand. All manufacturers seem to sell them as options (Garmin included).

We bought this external drive after learning that our friends lost all but a couple months worth of photos and/or videos from their first year with adorable triplet daughters. It resulted from the dreaded and inevitable hard-drive crash that everyone fears, but nobody thinks will happen to them. Attempts by two data recovery firms were unsuccessful and now they're left with whatever printed photos they and their family and friends could find.

Expecting our first child in less than three weeks, we don't want to find ourselves in the same predicament, especially with years of other irreplaceable photos, financial data and other documents on our laptop. Now we're doing weekly, monthly and annual backups and storing some of those offsite to protect against something even worse than a simple crash of a hard drive. Even if we don't completely stick with this new regimen, it's better than what we used to do -- which, though thankfully uneventful, was absolutely nothing.

If that's not enough to make you want to buy this, then the Sony name, quality, reliability and ease of use should be. The drive is small, stylish, easily installed and takes up little space in the vertical position. Although it's a little loud when the drive is working, it reads and writes CD-R media up to 48x, Ultra Speed Plus CD-RW up to 32x, DVD+/-R up to 16x, and High Speed DVD+RW up to 8x. After a lengthy initial full backup using the included Nero BackItUp software (about 8 GB onto 10 old CD-R discs in 2.5-3.0 hours), smaller differential monthly backups and incremental weekly backups to 8x DVD+RW discs take between 10 and 20 minutes each when compressing, copying and verifying everything. Backup copies of our 4 GB wedding DVD onto 8x DVD-R discs took about 15-20 minutes.

The Nero software seems very extensive, but I haven't used much of it so far. The interface is pretty intuitive and it's easy to find what you want to do, but some of the more detailed or technical options might be overwhelming for someone who's new to this kind of software or doesn't want to spend a lot of time reading the PDF manual. The only real complaint I have is with the BackItUp program's job scheduler, which only gives you daily, weekly and yearly frequency options (you need to set up monthly backups as weekly jobs and either disable or skip them for several weeks in between months), it takes forever to re-scan files when building a new job on an existing one (setting up subsequent daily, weekly or monthly jobs based on the initial full annual backup), and the data you can change for an existing job is limited (can't rename it or alter the content without creating a whole new job).

Overall, great external DVD/CD drive for watching video, listening to music and backing up data. Good software that's intuitive and functional with some room for improvement, but there's no real need for additional software you don't already have. Excellent value -- bought it at Amazon for under $160 with taxes and free shipping, and got a $30 mail-in rebate from Sony. Also bought pack of 25 Ritek 8x DVD+RW discs from TheTechGeek.com for $33 delivered and they threw in a free 10-pack of Velocity 8x DVD-R discs. So, for well under $200 and a little effort, you too can view, hear, copy and/or backup your valuable photos, videos, tunes and other data in no time

The printer is fast and printing is always properly aligned on the paper. Quality of printed text is as good as any decent desktop printer and that is why I bought it in the first place. I am yet to try printing photos. Because this is a mobile printer the manufacturer needs to ensure that the unit will stand up to the hits and accidents caused by regular transporting. It might mean providing a second skin or a padded bag with the uni

I bought this enclosure about 1 year ago.  I put a 200GB hard drive in it and use it as my dedicated iTunes library. It was a super easy setup.  Many complain in the other reviews that it's a tight fit inside, but I didn't find it difficult at all to get the hard drive in.  After connecting the hard drive and closing it  up, I simply connected it via FireWire to my Mac G4 and it worked like a charm! Next month I will have it for 1 year and I would be 100% happy with it if not for one thing... the loud fan noise after about 10 minutes of it being turned on! ARGHH!!  All of a sudden it just starts sounding off with this annoying buzzing sound that gets slightly louder with time.  Every-so-often, the buzzing goes away for about 1 to 2 minutes, but it ALWAYS returns with a vengence!  Otherwise, the enclosure has held up and worked nicely for almost 1 year.  I'm definitly going to get rid of it though once I find an enclosure that is equally aesthetically pleasing and as reliable, but not NEARLY as noisy!!!  It's a shame actually, since I'm in the market to get 2 more enclosures to house my Aperture library and data backup, respectively

I just purchased this item two days ago (Thurs.) Today (Sat.) I removed my 160GB Seagate HHD from my Kingwin enclosure and installed it in this one. Installation was not a problem although the molex connector seems to be a tight fit and is almost touching the fan. Fan noise does not seem to be a problem yet. I used the Firewire connection instead of USB and the drive access is much faster than it was with the USB connection on the other enclosure. The price is a little steep compared to others but I got a generous rebate offer with my purchase. Although the case is plastic (my other one was aluminum and plastic) I won't be moving mine around so that won't be an issue

This cable really cleaned up the display image. I had been running another Monster Cable - the 6 meter version. I needed the length before because of the way my system was configured. I have a review under that cable about how quality does matter.

And so does length. At the time I wrote the review I was just ordering the cable and was posting what I had found out in researching digital video signals. Everything in there stands true.

I changed my setup and decided to invest in a shorter version of the cable - the 1 meter version - because I could now get away with a much shorter cable. I installed it this morning and the difference, while not earth shattering, was definitely visible.

I use this cable to connect between the video card on a media PC and my TV (Sony rear-projection LCD). The image used to swim a little along the edges of some windows, text, etc., and the image wasn't as clear as I had hoped. While the image looked good, it didn't look great. That's why I decided to take the plunge and spend an extra $79 bucks.

The difference is somethine like going from a regular RF feed to your TV and component video cables. Now the image is crisp and clear and there is no swimming. It actually brings out detail I couldn't even see before - to the point of deciding to turn on FSAA and filtering so video games have a more realistic look. And that they do.

I don't know how other brands compare to the Monster Cables as I haven't tried them. What I do know is that signal integrity is very important to a good looking display. You can get that with high quality cables and by keeping the length to the absolute minimum required as there was a very perceptible difference just between the 1 meter and 6 meter versions of the exact same thing.

One more thing while I'm here. I want to thank Amazon for going the extra mile on customer service. I had a DVD disappear somehow during shipping. UPS said they delivered it but I never received it. I asked Amazon if they filed the report with UPS or I did to file a claim. What I got was a reply telling me a replacement was already on its way. That is service. Thanks Amazon

I almost didn't purchase this CD player because of all the bad reviews it had been getting, but I decided to go for it! I am glad I did, I am very happy with this Sony Walkman! I use it for walking, listening to meditating CDs, audio books, everything and have not had one single problem with it. I am so glad I did not let the few negative reviews sway my decision! As mentioned in another review, I love that if you have to stop playing whatever your listening to it will pick up on the same track when you press play again, it also fits in my back pocket so I can walk around the house listening to anything while doing chores, the earpieces fit well, there is absolutley nothing wrong with this walkman! Those of you who seemed to have this walkman break in 2-3 weeks must not take care of your things. I love it, the price was great, so don't let the negative reviews stop you on this purchase!

The product works fine. It seems kind of strange that I had to purchase a package of 10 in order to get just the 2 that I needed. The Linksys unit is just attached to the bracket by pressure so I ran a long zip tie through the bracket and around the Linksys units to make sure they didn't pop off

Besides the fact that iPod is a skinny little waste of time, let's also mock the fact that it plays about two formats: whatever Mac plays, and MP3.  Woohoo.   What a selection.

Then, we have the iAudio.  It has perhaps a half inch thickness, at most, over the iPod for the standard battery model (20gb and 30gb anyway; 60gb is as thick as an XL), though it includes so much more bang for your buck, even if some of that bang is kind of useless.  But come on; an FM radio isn't iPod standard?  Almost every other portable HD player has that by now.  

About the only thing iPod has over iAudio is movie quality, which is, admittedly, better.  But I'm fairly basic; I'm buying it for my music, not to watch a bloody movie on a tiny screen.  If I want to do that, I'll buy a portable DVD player. For pictures, unless they're ridiculously high quality, this suits just fine.  But it's not the pictures you should be interested in when buying one of these sweet players; it's the sound quality.

Which.  Is.  Marvelous.   It consistantly beats iPod, it has BBE equalizer, and it not plays MP3 and AAC, but WMA, WAV, OOC, and FLAC.   *FLAC.*   And if you download Rockbox (which is something you'll have to research on your own, kids), you can create themes, boost your battery life, and augment your listening pleasure even further.

The only drawbacks are the battery life if you don't use playlists, skip around a lot, or play high bitrate files (all of which are fixed rather well by Rockbox), and the subpack.   What is a subpack?   It's a fairly good idea done badly.  It's a piece of [...] plastic you can easily lose that clicks into the bottom jack of your player.  In it are the power jack, line-out (which has a bad bass roll-off problem, unfortunately) and line-in jack, and USB port.   The general idea was to make the player smaller by moving all of these jacks onto something else, but it wasn't executed too well.  Buying a charger from [...].com solves the power jack and USB port problems nicely, and is recommended most highly.

(And did I mention recording with the built-in mic is amazing?  You can get good quality concerts with this puppy.)

Plus, it's black.  iPod comes standard white.  And the X5 is just better

It pairs quickly with laptops &amp; bluetooth phones. Holds the gps module firmly and matches the look perfectly.

The only gripe I have is it doesn't have an anti-slip surface so that I can throw it on the dashboard and not worry about it falling off.

The battery lasts forever. I remember using it for 6 continous hors before switching off...mind you switching off because I had arrived at my destination

Bought these to use while doing my daily walks &amp; mowing.  They work 100% better than the little "lipstick" antenna you get with the MyFi plus you don't have to use the earphones.  The only time I lose signal is if I'm really boxed in an area that doesn't face south.  It actually works in some areas inside my house.  The sound quality is good enough for a casual audiophile like me.  Besides, there ain't much in the way of other options.  This is my second pair because my first pair had the left channel crap out because of a broken wire after a year.  So I use them as an extra antenna in the kitchen when I want to use the FM tuner on the radio

Things that I like: 
(1) The option to tile the front of the keyboard up makes typing much more comfortable.  I was a skeptic about it before I purchased it, but really do like it.  Also, this is the first keyboard that I have used that allows for so many typing angles.  
(2) The included software gives a great deal of control over customizing all of the extra keys on the keyboard.  Even if you don't have Windows Vista, you can program the gadgets key to suit your needs.  
(3) The keyboard has no lag for me, whatsoever.  
(4) I'm a big fan of the standard 3x2 key setup for the home keys, etc.  
(5) This is a small change, but I'm using this setup on Dell Inspiron 6000 laptop.  The software replaced the large volume notifications (onscreen display showing volume level, mute, etc.) with a smaller more attractive style notification.  Me gusta.  
(6) The curved keyboard is also comfortable.  It requires no time nor effort getting used to it.  
(7) I haven't had any problems with the keyboard being "out of range."  
(8) For the mouse, I'm switching from the Wireless Intellimouse Explorer 3.0, which is also made by Microsoft, to the Laser 6000 mouse included.  This new mouse is more comfortable. (not a huge difference, but noticeable.)  It is also lighter, and slides around with little effort.

What I don't like:
(1) The lock key above the number pad is set by default to display the same two options as when you click 'Start' then 'Log off Windows.'  I would have liked the option to change the key to the Shut Down / Hibernate dialog instead.  I haven't found that option available, so far.
(2) The keyboard is a little bit wider than others, but I don't find it to be a problem.  It's just different.  Having the additional programmable buttons outweighs the downside of having the extra width.

Five Stars

I needed a replacement Receiver for a fairly modest home theater system. I wanted a bare bones 5.1 system (no 6.1, 7.1, 1kw audio power, satellite radio capable, etc.)  I only use the Receiver as an audio switch and let the TV handle video source selection.  Reviewers of the Sherwood RD-6500 liked the audio but thought the set-up a little confusing.  Being a retired electrical engineer that did not concern me.  The price was certainly right, about the cheapest thing around (at [...]).  I bought the unit and have been completely satisfied.  I would have given it five stars but heck, nobody's perfect.  I had no problem with the setup procedure and liked the audio quality (full disclosure:  my ears are 79 years old).  The unit has one optical digital, one coax digital and several A/V inputs.  The remote lets you pick Video 1-3, CD, Tuner and Aux inputs.  You tell the system which audio source to use for each of these, one time and it remembers.  I liked the way the front panel display tells you whether a full surround signal is present.  I was surprised to find how many premium HD movie channels do not always broadcast in full surround and not always in HD either.  I also liked the fact that one button on the remote cycles a test tone to all six speakers so you can quickly balance them.  On the negative side I, like other reviewers, bemoaned the lack of a switched power outlet since a powered sub-woofer is required

I have used These Seagate Drives for almost 2 years now. They work nicely for editing movies, and I like the combo Firewire and USB2.0 interface. I trust these cheaper Seagate than the expensive LACIE (we bought a box full of lacie D2, they ALL fail in 6 months) or store brand drives. Hard drives are prone to failure. But Seagate has served my company well.

I've held off reviewing this item until I actually got some alerts - and I got plenty of them over the weekend, so here it is....

There seem to be a lot of complaints of this being hard to set-up - so many, that after having no problems setting it up myself, I'd worried I'd done something wrong.  Over the weekend, a number of thunderstorms &amp; tornados rolled thorough my area - using the S.A.M.E alert system for my county - I received a notification for each warning.  

I purchased this radio specifically for the S.A.M.E alert system, living in central Mississippi, we get tornado warnings all spring - I didn't want a 2am alarm for a tornado 3 counties north of me.  

My one beef with the unit is the radio reception - even the included external antenna, it's spotty - ESPECIALLY the weather radio reception.  I'm not sure how far I am from the nearest weather radio transmitter, but living in the suburbs of Madison, I can't be too far.  If you're in a rural area, I'd definitely look into getting an external antenna (it has a port for a better external antenna than the telescoping antenna included)

I purchased a SanDisc 4 GB SDHC card for my camera. At the time it did not occur to me that neither my SanDisc Image Mate 6 in 1 nor my SIIG 18-in-1 Reader/Writer would not be able to read this new version of Secure Digital. Long story short-I called IOGear tech support and was assured that this reader would work although netiher their promotional materails nor their packaging indicates that it will. Bottom Line: It works and it was a very inexpensive ($10 at CompUSA) solution to my problem.

I got this yoke to use with Microsoft Flight Simulator.  Other people have said that the build quality is poor on this yoke, but what did you expect?  It's just a computer game controller, it's not meant to feel like an actual pilot's yoke.  If it were, it would probably be much, much more expensive!

Yes, the plastic build makes it feel like just another joystick, but I've had it for almost a year and haven't had any problems with it.  Also, I rarely need to reconfigure it, so there's not an issue of "wandering" from the centre point.

All in all, this yoke is fairly good and works well with Flight Simulator.  It certainly makes you feel a little bit more like you're a real pilot, but don't expect to feel any G-forces or anything else like that

This univeral DVD player comes packed very neatly in an Oppo cloth case and is very sleek.  The finish of the DVD player is excellent, however the remote is not up to snuff in this department.  This player can play PAL DVDs, it upconverts it to NTSC &amp; 1080i.  It's loaded with features that you probably won't see on most DVD players out there.  The upconversion works well though I'm not sure the color handling is the best.  The audio controls in the setup are awesome.  People have complained about the disc tray being flimsy/cheap, but I think it's just fine.  It's very quick to load and play.  You may want to keep the remote safely because if you lose or damage it you won't be able to control most of the features.  The HDMI cable that is included with the player is of good quality.  Probably worth around fifty bucks in the market.  Price to performance/features you can't beat this universal DVD player.  Buy one and you'll know

I've had this for about a week, and it seems to be working very well. The "autoscan" feature is very nice since I seemed to forget to switch between "city" and "highway" with my older units.

The voice prompts are very clear, and the automute keeps the annoying beeps to a comfortable level.

I've had several radar detectors over the years, and this one certainly seems to be the best so far. It is also rated very highly in the amgazine articles I found

This is a direct comparision between the Linksys WUSBF54G and TrendNet 509UB.

Both perform as expected when used as a standalone hot spot detector.

Both perform as expected on Windows XP. Installation was quirky for both. After driver installation, inserting into USB slot it wasn't recognized at all. Fiddled around for awhile and it finally detected the device. Had to disable the notebook's builtin wireless before XP recognized the device.

Client software does not detect a device under Windows Vista Ultimate RC2. I assume this will be true for Windows Vista RTM too. Inserting the device into a Windows Vista RC2 system often completely froze Windows Vista (had to hold down power button for complete reboot). Had to disable the notebook's builtin wireless before Vista recognized the device.

Appears that the TrendNet and Linksys devices are so similar that they must be made by the same OEM or reference design. As expected, evaluation results are similar.

1. Both devices seem to have same sensitivity, similar to notebook's internal wireless card.
2. TrendNet device doesn't have Windows XP signed drivers so an extra click during install is requried. Also installing on new USB ports requires extra clicks.
3. TrendNet device supports 801.11a whereas Linksys does not.
4. TrendNet device sometimes crashes Vista Ultimate RC2.
5. Neither device's software client works under Vista Ultimate RC2. This isn't a deal breaker for me as they both work under Vista Ultimate RC2 networking as a USB wireless key. You just lose the client software feature.
6. The Linksys has a somewhat useful backlit LCD, TrendNet does not.
7. Both devices work as standalone hotspot locators equal well.
8. In hotspot mode, both devices show SSID, channel number, encryption mode, etc.

Conclusion: For XP, I recommend the TrendNet so save the extra dollars. For Vista, I recommend the Linksys device as it never crashed Vista Ultimate RC2 whereas TrendNet device was gave occasional freezes

I am so grateful to all the reviewers of this product for convincing me to give it a try.  I have a six-year old Hitachi DVD player, and I lost the remote.  I couldn't play anything without it, because the buttons on the player don't allow me to select any tracks.  The instructions on this remote are incredibly easy.  It found my TV automatically, because it's set for a Sony TV by default.  When I had to locate a code for my DVD player, I got worried-- none of the 3 Hitachi DVD codes listed in the manual worked during the setup process.  But there's a search function to use in that situation, which allows you to scroll through all the codes in the chip's library till one works.  It found one within seconds, and I was up and running.  I think I'm going to buy this as a holiday gift for my siblings so they can get rid of all the remotes scattered around their living rooms

This is a great TV.  Bought after looking around for months.  Receive HDTV signals, about a dozen without cable box.  The number will continue to rise, but all of the main shows and programs are in HD.  Especially for sports fans almost every broadcast is in HD.  True you will only get about 720P resolution from the broadcast over the air currently, but when the Blue-ray HD movies are out in larger number and at a more reasonable price, this will become the standard.  And this TV has 2 HDMI ports so you are ready to go.  I have had another CRT sharp which I have liked, and this product is no different.  Picture is amazing.  Some analog channels dont look that great, but I am at the point where where I would rather watch whatever is on an HD channel.  
Note:  I am in what is considered an upgraded cable section.  The TV has the tuner to receive HD without the box as I have said, but I can't speak to sections that are not "upgraded", so you may want to look into that.  Nice to receive without paying for extra equipment.

If you're considering the ViaMichelin (under $200 GPS), you're probably trying to decide if a GPS that is more than $100 cheaper (much more than $100 in some cases) than its competitors is really any good. Honestly, I would have been skeptical too, however, a relative bought one of these units, and that gave me a chance to get their feedback before I decided to purchase one myself.

My brief summary is that Yes, this unit is a good GPS and a great value. After using mine on a trip, I'd have a hard time justifying the more expensive models when this one works fine.

Background: my GPS experience is limited to a 7-year old Garmin III Plus. I had to plan detailed trips on my PC using Mapsource, then upload the waypoints and routes to the GPS. It could be a time consuming process, and because the unit wasn't necessarily user friendly, my wife never learned how to use it.

Enter the ViaMichelin. We just went on a weekend trip and had a chance to test the unit. Set-up time for the trip was about a minute - all I had to do was program in the street address of our destination.

Now for the rundown.

First - what it doesn't do well.
a) Using it for the past two weeks (as a test only) around my home town, I was a little disappointed.  It never sent me the wrong way, but it didn't always take the best route.  Some of the routing issues were because of very new road construction in the area; and in some cases old "logging" roads are still in the database where new subdivisions have been built; and it may not calculate what my experience dictates to be the better route. Although this was disconcerting at first, I don't think it is a big deal as you'll see later.
b) Macro-directions - i.e. for a several hundred mile trip. It will get you there, and if you're taking a route that involves some smaller roads between towns, this would be a good device if you aren't familiar with the route. But my route this weekend was very simple. Get to the interstate and drive. It didn't pick my preferred route to the interstate, and it wanted to route me through a city before putting me on the interstate when you can take a four-lane road for 4 miles to another connection to the interstate. (Although it did recover and finally suggest my route as I stubbornly drove "my way.") So, for a major trip, I'd recommend an internet mapping package for the primary route.  Use this device if you have a lot of mind-numbing turn-by-turn.

Now, what it does well:
a) voice prompts are great. It doesn't matter that it doesn't say the street names. Turn right in 300 feet is good enough - especially with the map that you can glance at.
b) It did great around my destination towns of Charlotte, NC; Gastonia, NC, and Rock Hill, SC.  Did it take the best route as I drove from soccer fields, to hotels, to restaurants?  I don't know since I wasn't familiar with the areas, but the routes seems to be just fine, they got me exactly where I needed to go, and I never had to look at a road map.  And after all, this was the main reason I needed a newer GPS. It passed this with flying colors.
c) My wife did some of the set-up while in the car. She'll be using this one on her on very soon.
d) We wanted to find a particular restaurant, but didn't have the street address. The restaurant was in the Points of Interest database, and it took us right to it. Also, finding rest stops or nearby dining while traveling on the interstate was great.

I also found a feature that was not listed in the 89-page manual.  From the navigation map, if you touch the screen, it has a "bypass route" option. It will give you some distant options (1 mi, 5 mi, etc.) then it will find a bypass route for you. So, if you are approaching road construction or a traffic jam, this will route you off the interstate, take you up the road and bring you back on.  Obviously you could just turn off the interstate and start driving, but then it's going to try to turn you around and/or try to get you back on sooner than you prefer.  The bypass route lets you see where it is taking you by zooming out.

In the future, I would like to do a side-by-side comparison w/ a more expensive (borrowed) GPS. Also, after more experience, I'd like to update this review.

Bottom line: I am glad I bought this unit. I cannot imagine spending $100-$500 more on a more expensive model. Though the higher priced models may have better features, the value for the extra money just isn't there for me

One of the few of these type of items available on the market. I bought it with great trepidation after reading all the reviews. I had received some free drives from Newegg (Seagate) and needed to house them. This was a no brainer set up. The utility found it immediately without me having to mess around with turning virus protection or firewalls off. (XP pro SP2). The firmware was one rev prior so I updated it - absolutely smooth as silk. Reformatted the drives. I chose the RAID 1 option and ext3 format. I like the fact that you can specify RAID size and the leftover is formatted as striped volume. The drive is fairly solid. The fan is not very noisy. The front slide up access door is a little kludgy. Good user interface. I was also surprised with the speed of transfer especially having chosen RAID and ext3. The only thing I can never get to work and it is 100% MY lack of knowledge is the email alerts. I couldn't get Infrant to do it and same with this one.

As an aside I love Amazon and NewEgg. Great retailers both of them

Had mine for over half a year now, and after outstanding abuse it performs as well as the day I bought it.  I fill it and empty it every month, rarely ever defragging it, back up my PC files and play movies right off it on my laptop.  Throw it in my backpack, plug and unplug it all day(hotswaping), still with rarely a sign of slowdown, and it barely gets from cool to warm ever(even when its running from inside my backpack).

For some reason requires two usb ports on my new PC (high speed USB2.0 ports) when it shouldn't.  It runs on one port at school just fine and I have switched the y cable with a regular usb cable with 50% success.

I'd buy another one of these in a heartbeat if I ever thought the one I have would run itself out.  The fact that it doesn't need an external AC adapter to run on my USB1.1 laptop ports(though it does have a hole for a non-included AC adapter)is a blessing.  I've even used its double usb cord to run my power hog of an external cd-rom drive(my cd-rom AC doesnt work on both sadly).  Might be luck of the draw, HD related items seem to be sometimes, and I've yet to have to try out their customer service.  But overall worth every cent spent(especially since I was looking at a 4GB external for $40 before I saw this). Nearly $1 a gig is a great deal.

This was a perfect fit for my 13" Macbook. Tried a couple cheaper ones, but was never satisfied, usually they were just a bad fit. This is by far the best, holds the computer in place and is light weight. It's true you get what you pay for. One complaint, the extra pocket in front could be larger

I originally bought this CD case for my car, because I listen to CDs the most while driving.  This was not a good case to bring back and forth at all.  It is very large and heavy (even without CDs!), and the long zipper-tail makes it hard to open with one hand.  I now use it to house computer software and playstation/gamecube games.  For what you pay, it is an excellent buy

This is a great value for money and it is very silent and soen not get hot.  It is also silent and convenient.  It is more flexible with the FAT 32 format it comes in but I preferred the NTFS file format whice is safer and more stable.  It was no problem to reformat to NTFS

I got the Griffin iTrip to enjoy my iPod in my car, and then I HAD to get a Belkin TuneBase for iPod mini! With the short battery life that is further aggravated when using the iTrip, the TuneBase keeps my iPod charged so that I don't have to plug it into my computer's USB port every night after work

This is my second iRiver product. The first one was fine but it couldn't survive a trip through the washing machine. This one works well, is easy to navigate through, good sound. The case is rather cheap. The other one was rigid plastic. This case is hard to use and makes it difficult to change the batteries. The software leaves something to be desired so I use Windows Explorer to add songs and rearrange the order. All in all, this is a great little mp3 player

I use this on my MacBook. Works flawlessly to hookup a TV via svideo. OSX handles this supremely well by remembering any video settings that I use when i have it hooked up. Plug it in and video switches to tv settings, unplug it and its back to normal. I use this with dual view mode so that my desktop stays the same always on the macbook, and i just get extra desktop space when I plug the tv in.
The quality is quite suprising for s-video, very good.
100% must have for anyone that has a nice tv :

It works fine, but it gets really annoying when you're using it with a widescreen Mac and a widescreen TV. The zoom function most plasmas and LCD TVs have is 16:9 aspect ratio, whereas Macs are at 16:10 aspect ratio, so you can either cut off the top and bottom of what you're trying to display, or have massive letter-boxing. After three months, I still haven't had any glitches that were this adapter's fault.

If you have HDMI or DVI on your TV or projector, don't bother with this. Go straight to DVI with a Mini-dvi to DVI adapter, then get a DVI to DVI cord or a DVI to HDMI cord

Yes, it plays videos (DivX + Windows Media tested so far).

Yes, it plays and sorts your photos.

Yes, it plays MP3s and sorts them by their ID3 tags (artist/genre/album/etc.).

Yes, it comes with a good TV audio/video out cable (letting you use the Zen like a high-def digital video player).

Yes, you can download your CompactFlash card directly onto the Zen hard drive.

Yes, it syncs with your Outlook tasks and calendar.  Wha?  Yeah.  It's hidden in there too.  Along with an MP3 alarm clock.

If you're going on vacation with a digital camera anytime soon, this is the multi-tool for you.  Leave the laptop at home.  The Zen has plenty of battery life and plenty of room for music, movies and photos to keep you moving for days when you're unwired from the office

...I have been using this drive for a few months now and have no complaints.  One of my laptops only has a USB 1.x port and it is incredibly slower for backups.  That has no reflection on this product, but be ready for things to work slowly unless you have USB 2.x and don't blame it on this drive.  :

I love the Sling Media Slingbox Tuner!  The install was very easy just as they had said on the reviews.  The quality of picture is just as good as on my Cable TV.  I have a great processor with the highest internet speed I could get though my cable so that may contribute to the good quality picture and color I get with it and may also be the reason I have had no problems with doing computer work and watching the screen at the same time. Plue my shipment from Amazon was in 2 days!  You rock Amazon!

I BOUGHT THIS LIKE A IPOD BUT ITS BETTER I HAVE ABOUT 20 MOVIES ON IT AND ABOUT 500 SONGS AND SOME PHOTO'S AND STILL HAVE 50 GIGS LEFT. THE ONLY HANG UP IS YOU STILL HAVE TO GO PAY ANOTHER 20.00 TO GET THE PLUG-IN DOWNLOAD THAT LETS YOU SHOW MOST OF THE MOVIES. THEY SAY IT CAN DO ALL THIS STUFF BUT NOT WITH OUT DOWNLOADS AND SOME ADD ON'S ONCE YOU GET ALL THAT THERE ARE HOURS OF FUN TO BE HAD.

After all the hype on-line about the T-amp, I had to check it out for myself.  All the reports are true!  This is one hot little audio amp which can not be touched for the price.  If you have a portable audio device and two speakers you need to drive with it - this amp is for you.  You will not be disappointed.  I recommend purchasing the AC power supply as well.  You can find others cheaper, but the recommended one works perfectly and insures the warrantee for the T-amp remains valid

I purchased this as an extra phone so I could access both phone lines on the second floor of my house. Well-built with hold and 3-way conferencing features, sound quality is good and it has selectable ring levels for each line. Powered from the phone line, no external power is used. One drawback: the line indicator doesn't light when the line is being used by other phones in the house.

After reading several reviews of this product I was skeptical about buying this cable.  I wanted a better cable then the composite rca cables that came with my PS2 but I was not sure about paying the price for these when the Sony cables are about half the cost of the Monster Cables.  The reviewers commenting on the cable not fitting into the PS2 properly and the component connectors being too tight to fit onto the TV almost discouraged me from even buying this product.  I decided to bite the bullet and purchase these cables for my PS2.  I am very happy that I decided to buy these cables.  The cable connector fits perfectly into my PS2, better than the connector on my original Sony cables even.  The connectors fit nicely onto my TV, they are snug but not too tight.  I believe they fit snuggly onto the component jacks on my TV because of the 8-cut turbine connector, which fits better than a standard RCA plug.  The video and audio from my PS2 is unbelievable.  My PS2 pushes the video signal to my 32" LCD HD TV at 480i with these cables.  With my stock composite cables the graphics in my games were grainy and sometimes blurry.  Now the graphics are crisp and clear and I only wish I would have bought these sooner.  The display from my PS2 and games fits nicely onto my TV in widescreen now too, before the picture was not centered on my TV and sometimes parts of my game screens would be off the screen.  I would recommend these cables to anyone who wants to improve the video and sound quality of their PS2 over the stock Sony cables.  There are other Monster Cable versions for the PS2 available so choose the one that is right for you, but if you want something that is moderately priced, don't need digital audio via fiber, and the next best thing to HDMI than this is the cable for you.  I am going to get the Monster component cables for my PS3 next so I will be able to hook it up when I don't have HDMI available for it to use.

One more thought, be sure to change the video output on your PS2 from RGB to Y Cb/Pb Cr/Pr in the system configuration before hooking up your PS2 with these cables or it may not work.  My TV told me the connection was not supported and I did not have video output until I changed the video output setting on my PS2

I wanted something to use while mowing the lawn without emptying my bank account.  Cuts the lawnmower noise to a tolerable level, and the sound quality is decent.  Headphones are comfortable and adjust easily.  Unit collapses down to a more manageable size for transportation.  Good battery life

Recently bought this receiver to replace a dead one.  There isn't really anything special about this receiver, but it a solid one.  The two year warranty tells me they stand by their product, in case of a problem (hopefully I won't need to use the warranty).  It gives good, clean power and sound.  Don't let the 75W/channel fool you.  This is a high current receiver and it has a good amount of power.  Time will tell, however, how well this receiver performs.  Also, for the price Amazon was selling for, I couldn't pass it up.

     Unit installed in seconds with no false starts or headaches of any kind. The base is wide and heavy and when placed on a mouse pad doesn't move around at all, even when I get a little too "into" my flight sim games. One can't beat the price either. For flying prop planes, I am very saisfied with the performance

First time I've ever written a review.  I'm not a high tech type, and sometimes it's nothing but frustration for me to deal with high tech stuff.  This remote was a breeze to program, and works fantastic.  My wife and daughter are even less high tech and love it.  Any problems with use, just press "help" and the remote with ask you questions and correct the problem.  Highly recommended

This cartridge is very light, easy to install and allows the printer to print out very good quality, durable black ink on the page. It is competitively priced and stores for about a year after you buy it so if you want to stock up for your office or personal printing needs that's great! (It even comes with an expiration date!) HP also packs it well so that it is difficult for the cartridge to become damaged during transit. 

One thing that I didn't like, however, is that the ink can go quickly. If you print a lot, you might even need to replace this cartridge every ten days or so. My needs are about 20 pages per week and I have to change the cartridge roughly every five to six weeks. That's not good; although to be fair to this HP ink cartridge I am printing graphics. 

Four stars (well, maybe three and one half stars) for being great ink in an easy to manage and install cartridge. It loses points for not lasting longer.

I've been struggling with heat issues for quite some time with my gaming PC and have gone through numerous fans and combinations trying to find a way to keep it cool.  I had just about resigned myself to just running with the case open all the time until I bought this.  After shuffling my PCI cards around so as to allow a space between this and my 6800 Ultra I fired the machine up (and closed the case! ;-) and did some gaming, all the while keeping an eye on the temperature of the card.  This fan easily dropped the temperature on the card 5-7 degrees celsius when the graphics are running full bore.. once the chaos on the screen starts to subside, the cooling is even better.  As an added bonus, this will cool the card down quick once you exit your game.  

I thought for sure that I would have to trade off cooling for a lot more noise and I was surprised to find that I had to listen for it in order to hear it.  About the only complaint I have on this is that the fan speed is manual with a slider on the back (which I knew when I bought it) so it is not temperature sensitive.  Still deserves 5 stars though

Just purchased earbuds at target.  Excellent sound quality, expected that much due to a previous of full headphones.  Even better once you find the right adjustable tip to fit your ear.  Well worth my 100 dollars, granted, I've only had them 5 to 10 minutes, but I won't be returning them any time soon

Bought it for my wife and she loves it. It keeps track of where you were and restarts from there. The display is small (no fancy menus like Ipod)but works well. Sound is excellent.

Be sure to install the drivers and software. The software is small, simple and EASY to use - or you can just COPY/PASTE files onto it.

If you DON'T install the drivers it only works at USB 1.1 speeds and takes a LOT longer to load songs. With drivers you get full 2.0 speeds

This Bluetooth remote device works as advertized with my Apple notebook.  Be sure to insert the Bluetooth card all the way into the printer slot before you begin.  I thought mine was in far enough at first, but it really wasn't.  One caveat:  I was hoping that the Bluetooth signal would be strong enough to enable printing from the next room, but it's not.  Also new users should know that they can set up their computer to handle both Bluetooth and cable at the same time

Length of ownership: 8 weeks

This puppy really reaches out. My laptop's internal intel/pro wireless sees about 6 networks but with the Hawking dish a typical haul is 20 networks. Thanks to some friendly neighbors I've said goodbye to my paid isp and now enjoy casual and free internet connections, and until metrofi completes its set up of free city-wide wifi I'll get by with that thanks to this neat Hawking device.

Unless I need the next and more expensive step up for such wifi booster devices I hope the Hawking dish proves durable..after all it's been just 2 months of ownership so far, albeit good ones.

Note: For me this device has not seemed very directional in that it will pick up off-beam signals fairly well. Also, placement by a window will help your reception

I purchased the Hawking HWU8DD on the recommendation of several other RVers. WiFi signals at RV parks tend to be unreliable. Until now, the built-in antenna on my laptop could "see" the signal at my park but could not access it. As soon as I installed the software and connected the Hawking antenna via USB port, I immediately accessed my campground's signal.  The Hawking antenna has solved a major problem for me.

This product with the assoicated software (included) is everything you hope it is but really don't believe it will be.  The x-ray glasses you saw advertized in the back of the comic book when you were a kid cost you $1.50 to learn a lesson why you should be skeptical.  The Garmin is the real deal.  I bought it for my son (a high school state (Indiana)level miler).  When he took off for his first workout and got home an hour later, he uploaded his entire workout onto the computer and low and behold his whole course with speeds, times, street names, etc., showed up on our computer, starting with the satallite photograph of our patio!!!!

I just made a long trip from Miami, Florida, all the way to S. Carolina, with a Explorist XL loaded with DirectRoute V3, everything worked just fine, I installed the software, unlock It, upload the maps, all with out any problems, the unit was very fast and accuracy didn't need to keep it over the dashboard, from inside the vehicle worked very well, never took more than a minute to track all satellites, the street route where very accurate, never  got lost, working with POI's was very simple, didn't have any problem handling very large maps I really recommend this unit

I gave my mother-in-law my old Color SporTrack so she could start Geocaching.  I was in search of a handheld unit with a bigger brighter screen.  This unit is it. 

Although it is large, it has features I like: AA batteries (19 hours?, we'll see), easy menu navigation, USB connection to a PC and a rugged case.

I am an engineer so am kind of picky about user interfaces, etc.  I have sent in a list of problems I have found with the menu navigation. All of them can be worked around, but it doesn't work the way I think they intended.  It will be interesting to see if Magellan gets back to me and eventually provides a new version of FW (I am using 1.05).

After doing a lot of research about Megllan SW (mostly negative), I decided to go ahead and purchase the Mapsend DirectRoute v.3 DVD. I found it acceptable and have had no real problems using it. One nit, the files it creates are very small.  You need to edit a text file in the Magellan directoy to allow it to save and download larger files. But once you get the maps downloaded to your unit (very straight forward), the menus change to indicate turning direction.  Thus, it is getting closer to a crossover unit.  Interestingly, Magellan will offer a new unit called the "Crossover" (available January 2007). The specs are pretty sparse on the Magellan web page

I also purchased this product because of the quality of the receiver made by Sony. This 7.1 channel Home Theater with HDMI passthrough is a great machine that money can buy. If you are looking for quality, surround sound in your livingroom, or your own Home Theater, this s the product you should invest in. This is a great investment for me. I am glad I found it in Amazon

The Lexar JumpDrive Lightning 2GB flash drive has very impressive performance ratings of 160X (24MB/sec) sustained Read and 120X (18MB/sec) sustained Write speed capability.  This is one of the very few USB drives that lists the Read/Write speed capabilities.

The "reality" of flash drives is that the smaller the file size, the slower the transfer rate will be.

I ran some tests with the Lightning to see what the transfer rate and the elapsed time is for groups of various file sizes:
* 433MB	 784 medium files, avg. 550KB	12X	4 min. 3 sec. 
* 483MB   81 large files, avg. 6MB      54X	59 seconds 
* 1GB	   1 very large file           115X	58 seconds

So, even though the Write speed capability of the Lightning is 120X, the transfer rate drops to 12X with medium size files, which is fairly "real-world" usage.  

But, don't let that dissuade you from considering the Lightning:  The higher the "speed capability" of the device, the better the transfer rate will be and the less time it will take to transfer those smaller files. 

To prove this point, I took one of my "great deal" CF cards (that had no speed ratings) that tops out at 36X Read / 7X Write, and ran two of the same tests: 
* 433MB	784 medium files   3X	15 min. 10 sec. 
* 483MB	 81 large files    7X	 7 min. 48 sec.

So, compared to the Lightning, the "great deal!" card took nearly 4 times longer to Write the medium files and 8 times longer to Write the large files.  So, which is the better deal when you use the device over and over and over...

Whether you are shopping for a card or a stick for digital cameras or a USB flash drive, if the performance numbers are not specified, BEWARE!  What you might think is a great deal may get you a device with very poor performance that you will regret purchasing.  I know, I have several in my drawer.

So, my bottom-line advice is:  Look for the highest-rated device you can find.  Flash devices will last a looong time and our file sizes and amount of data will only grow!  So "future-proof" your purchase by shopping for a high-rated and large capacity for now and the future.

(I have no relationship with Lexar or the Flash memory industry.

I haven't had any problems using this DVD/CD burner over Firewire on a G4 iMac running Mac OSX Tiger. In fact, setting the drive up was easier than what was recommended in the manual; it was truly plug-and-play.

Minor quibbles: the open/close button is hard to reach when the disc tray is extended, the black plastic face of the drive looks cheesy compared to the cool aluminum case, and only the Lite version of Toast 6 is included.

Bottom line: I would buy this burner again, given my experiences using it

The product works great. What i didn't like was not having the attachment to charge the battery in my home. It only came with the cigarette lighter power source.

I bought this SD card and took some 100 snaps out of it.The card is really fast with my canon A510 camera.Reading takes a slightly longer time than writing.I would recommend this card to anyone.Actually this card outperforms the 16MB MMC supplied with the camera.Also the 256MB card will hold upto 200 (may be lesser) 3.2MP pictures.

I purchased this card a month ago. I use it on my Dell Axim X3i. So far it has been fully compatible, fast, and flawless. I haven't owned another PDA or SD card so I can't give you a first-hand benchmark. But I can say that accessing the card is quick and I have not had any skips while playing my music files. The 256MB is good for the price if you wait for Amazon to drop their price in conjunction with the manufacturer's rebate

the Klipsch igroove can go toe to toe with the more expensive bose sound wave all day long. I researched dockable ipod / mp3 players for a few months before I decided on this one for my wife's office. 

I'm fussy when it comes to quality audio equipment, the I-grove does not disappoint. It provides room filling sound with no distorion. 

I listened to it extensively before wrapping it up for xmas to make sure it had the quality I insist on. It delivered.

Another bonus with the Klipsch is it's ability to accomodate other mp3 players and / or personal compact disc players.

I'm completely satisfied with my purchase of the Klipsch i-Groove.

I bought one for a relative last Christmas. Saw how convenient and easy it was to program. So I bought one for myself this March. It works just great.

The setup software programs the 670 easily and the Logitech remote replaces the remotes for a HDTV, a DVD Home Theater A/V Receiver, a DishHD DVR Receiver, and a Psyclone PSC01 Source Selector.  One button click now setups all those devices to the right status for a particular entertainment activity. 

I like the color screens and icons on the higher end  Logitech remotes .. but the discrete placement of buttons on the 670 is much more practical for me to use. Function wins forms this time round.

All is not rosy though. Added the Sony PS3 to the   entertainment arena.  The Bluetooth requirements of the PS3 leaves it out of the IR RF remotes inner circle. Consider this  if you need a combined solution for Infra Red  RF as well as Bluetooth devices. ( The Sony PS3 is deliberately left powered on so it is not an issue in this case). Fully backlit is a signifcant bonus..none of the replaced remotes had adequate backlit features. 

Short version: This cool tool really works and should satisfy most. Think "out of the box" though if you have a Sony PS3 tied into your entertainment network.

My wife and I have maybe a dozen or so devices connected via WiFi spread throughout our four-bedroom home. Among these were an Avaya 4610SW SIP (VOIP) phone and a PC serving as an Asterisk server (Asterisk is an open source PBX). This configuration has worked well for a couple of years now. In the past few months I've been having occasional disconnects of VOIP calls coming in to Asterisk from the PSTN. After some investigation, I decided to move my phone and server off WiFi and onto a HomePlug network, using the electrical wiring as another Ethernet. The hardest part of the installation was freeing up an electrical outlet in my second-floor office where my phone is, in the basement where the server is, and in the family room on the first floor where the LinkSys WiFi router/access point is located. After that, it was just a matter of plugging in an Ethernet cable from the Netgear box to the router, and moving the Ethernet cables from the WiFi boxes for the phone and server to the Netgear boxes. It was that simple.

[...]
I wish all high-tech equipment were this easy to install

I have, and have had, lots of SW radios including a number of Sonys.  This is one of their many gems.  Great perfomance, lots of memories and snazzy look. Good for travel (certainly not as compact as the SW100, of course).  A great radio to consider if you only want one shortwave radio, and don't want to spend very much. Good for listening, and good for DXing while traveling.  Look no further

Good job making a sturdy case that does not add too much bulk to a very thin device.  My major fear was that this would make my 1955 too thick and I would not use it.  It is just right and great protection for my 1955 - by the way I replaced a 4150 with this 1955 and case because my daughter accidently sat on my 4150 and broke the screen.  It is a great piece of protection

I bought this phone and three expansion handsets about a year ago and couldn't be happier.  The phones have the clarity of a corded phone.  The built in intercom system is perfect.  The phones allow you to "name" the handsets as we did (Kitchen, Basement, Bedroom, etc) so you can page based on location rather than remembering numbers.  They have a reliable and effective speakerphone built in, as well as jacks for headset (though the speakerphone seems to make this unnecessary.

One problem with these phones is the batteries.  In the year that we have had them, the battery life on all of the phones has degraded severely.  Often my wife would be on conference calls for one to two hours, and we would go through all four phones.  Leave a phone off the charger and in a day it's useless.  The only solution was to replace the batteries (which was significantly cheaper and easier than buying new phones and re-programming all the phone numbers).  I recommend the Energizer ER-P240, which is a Nickel-Metal Hydride battery and won't develop the Ni-Cad memory effect.

I love that the base station has a place for 4 AAA batteries so that the system can still be used during a power outage

It's more than great.
It fits my pocket, and it's music quality is great.
My sister and I bought this incredible MP3 with doubts but, it is more than great.
If somebody is considering buying an MP3, I strongly recommend to buy this iRiver.

Thank you, thank you, thank you

These speakers can almost hit any range of sound, but if anything they are a little weak on the bass side.  They put out very crisp sound for my system.  You might want to add a sub to them for complete range sound

If you're looking at this page you probably already know a lot about HP calculators.  Chances are you either had a 32SII and don't want to go the Ebay route or wanna slim down from that 48/49 series because you don't really need that extra functionality.  Is the 33S perfect?  No, not by a long ways, but it's the best thing we've got.  If you want a new scientific RPN calculator this is it.

This battery will transform your Epson PictureMate Deluxe Viewer Edition from a nifty little photo printer into an absolute Must Have item ! I take it with me when ever I'm doing an off-site photo shoot, or even when I'm out for a weekend shooting candids. The portability you get by adding this battery to the printer is priceless. I have printed as many as 40 photos on one charge.

Not so many words to talk about this item, but let me tell you that now I always use my rino turned on, in my car. baterie drain its no more cash pain!

**Good things:
-comes with a led(small light) that turns on with diferent colors(red green yellow) so you could know if your rino its turned on or of or disconected.
-large cable(for a car, you could use youre rino in the back seat even conected in the front of the car)

**bad things
just a bad ending quality, it looks like a adapter of 2.99bucks, but I had owned it for more than a year and cero problems.

I have had this item for about 6 weeks.  Haven't used to a lot, but so far I like it.  This power inverter is smaller and looks nicer than my old one, which was stolen out of my car along with a few other things.

It has one electrical outlet, and above that is a cigarette lighter outlet, so if you have other devices that need that kind outlet you can use them while this power inverter is plugged in.  

The plug fits kind of loosely in my cigarette lighter outlet, but I don't know if that's the plug or the outlet on my car.  

The only thing I don't like about this item is the "no tangle" cord.  Its one of those coiled up cords, like a telephone cord (look at the picture of the item).  The cord is long enough that it could stretch to the backseat, but if I were to try this it would pull the plug out of the outlet.  Its coiled so tight that I couldn't really put it anywhere that would require the coil to be stretched.  It just annoys me that they call it a 36" cord.  For practical use not more than probably 18", but I don't have the item right in front of me to measure it.

I'll still give this item 5 stars.  4.5 if Amazon allowed 1/2 stars.

How often are you on the way to work or to a meeting and you end up getting stuck in the traffic jam of the century. Nobody is moving and you can tell it's going to be a while. It would make sense to brush up on those reports or your presentation while you're stuck, but who wants to eat up the battery on their laptop right before a presentation? This inverter allows you to plug in your laptop into your car - just like a wall outlet - no worries, work off your car's alternator instead of your battery and catch all your typos before you get to your appointment

Which was Nomadland.  The Bono-pod is beautiful.  However the inconsistency of the iPod itself is a nightmare.  I've had it just over a month now and it has started to randomly skip songs.  It's apparently a known problem with several models of the device, with no particular fix.  Great.

This is an exact replacement for the high quality, precision made suction cup mount that comes packaged with the Nuvi unit. Unlike many such suction cup products, this one sticks. I bought an extra for ease in "cross-decking" my one Nuvi unit between my two cars. I just leave the mounts in place on the windshields of both cars and move the Nuvi and power cord to whichever car I am using at the moment. A good convenience. Note that I attach this mount to the windshield. I have not tried the red-disc mounting plate that allows the mount to be attached to a pebbly-textured dashboard... I was scared off by the warning that ones you attach the red disk it is extremely hard to remove.

As of 2007 most of the bugs mentioned in the other reviews are fixed. The ipod fits snug as a bug in my unit and it even charges it.Youu can even find this as low as $140 or chaper.  Im not sure why the bad reviews.This is a wonderful dvd player and the newer one i got even plays your ipod through your tv if you want..older versions did not allow this. You should buy this.The video quality isnt great, but good,  thats why i gave it four stars instead of five It is bulky but you need room for the ipod to plug in. the only bad side is no ipod naviation from the menu. you must use the ipod itself..But being able to play your ipod and dvd through any tv with rca jacks (audio/video) is great..i can now backup my purchased ipod items to dvd since i have an eyetv250 which allows you to use your computer as a tv. the eyetv has rca jacks on the device which allows me to record it to my harddrive which i then use toast to burn my dvd..all in all its completely worth it. even as a stand alone dvd player it's great..never had the first proble

What can I say, I got a code at Chrismas time through the Amazon promotion and got this tv for $200. It's perfect for a master bedroom set and the picture is great. Why spend so much more than the regular Amazon price for a more expensive brand when you can get this tv? No problems and it works wonderfully! Great deal, with free shipping even!

I purchase this on Amazon for $499 no tax &amp; free shipping. You can not match this quality at this price. The HD with HDMI cable using Comcast digital box is outstanding. The sound is also better with the HDMI vs componet cables. The jacks are hard to connect in the back of the set and you need to set the picture to manuel mode. The picture is to red on the preset modes and looks like there is too much color. I looked at Samsung for $800 and I am glad I saved myself $300 with this LCD

I use an i-Pod mini in my car.  It is in the center console where it connects to the auxillary input.  I used to have to open the console to make changes or turn it on or off.  The air click allows me to do all of that with the remote that I leave in a tray outside the console.  It works just as it is supposed to with no problems at all.  It solved my problem and I am a very satisfied customer.

I have my iPod hooked up to the stereo on my motorcycle. The iPod stays tucked away in a safe place, and the remote gets strapped to the handlebar. All the needed functions are now at my fingertips. I can lock the iPod control pad, so it doesn't accidentally get bumped.

I also use the Griffin FM transmitter. Nice, but not nearly as slick as the remote. I can't use them both at the same time, but I don't need to

This one of those products your girlfriend wonders why you are wasting your money on, that turns out to make life so much easier.  It has allowed me to leave my ipod in my backpack on my way to work, and go through security to get into work, all without having to open my bag.  The remote has a velcro strap that I use to attach to the shoulder strap of my back pack.  I am able to start and stop tunes and change the volume without needing to pull the ipod out.  My only complaint was that the headphone jack should have a strap or something to help keep the headphones in all the way and the device could also have a strap.  As the device is made for active people it would be nice to know that everything would stay connected, because when things do come undone, you do have to open your bag and put it all back together and that defeats the point of having the air click.

After having my GPS come loose (barrel pin failure) on more than one occasion I decided to give this a try. 
I've now used this on a 2 month MTB tour of Nepal and Tibet. Held my Forerunner 301 securely on hundreds of miles of washboard, technical singletrack, etc. Also withstood countless grabby children and curious bystanders in numerous villages. 
You do NOT have to remove the wrist band to use it with the mount. I love the reassuring "snap" when it locks into the mount, and the wrist strap functions as a safety back up - although it never came loose from the mount on me. Convenient release allows you to remove it quickly and easily. My only very minor complaint is you have to remove the GPS from the mount to charge it.
It fit perfectly on my 1" (25.6mm) diameter bars.
Like it so much I just ordered the "oversize" mount for my motorcycle.

I'd been using wireless for gaming for the past 3 months and always had lag problems even if the latency said it was around 50. I got the set of these and they work awesome. Just plug one into an outlet next to your pc and one next to your router. Run the cat5 cables from one to the pc and one to the router and you are all set. Now I can do my gaming without the lag I got from wireless and have yet to have any problem with these. These are truly plug and play. Now if only they were a little cheaper

I purchased the LJ3390 to replace an existing LJ3320.  The $350 rebate available until the end of Oct was the deciding factor as it made the unit a very reasonable purchase.

My main interest in the upgrade was to purchase a network connected printer.  Duplex print capability was the other factor that tipped the scale in favour of the LJ3390 over the LJ3052.

I now have 3 desktop and 2 laptop printers all printing successfully.  All run XP SP2 and are either connected via a wired or wireless network connection.  Software installation went flawlessly.

While I can't comment about HP versus other vendor software, I can say that the LJ3390 software is a major improvement over that of my LJ3320.  Scanning is faster by at least a factor of 2X, quite likely more like 3-4X.  Printing of complex pages is also much faster, exactly what I would expect from a newer generation print engine and an HP Laserjet printer.

All in all I am very pleased that I upgraded.  It has met all my upgrade goals.  Printing is faster, scanning is much faster.  The network connectivity ensures anyone can print without another machine being forced to be a print server and constantly left on.  I haven't played with the fax side yet, but am hoping this finally let's me retire my trusty standalone fax machine.

This unit is battery powered and mine arrived with a dead battery, however, replacing that was quick and easy although irritating. After installation and use for a while, I noticed the unit also got rid of some direct dialed calls as well as computer generated calls. If you don't speak immediately after pickup, the telemarketer hears the tone and hangs up! Great Item..

I bought the Telezapper from John Whitaker and it was delivered in 3ays. It didn't work so I contacted John and he told me to return it and he would test and if it didn't work he would send me a new one . He was good to his word and promptly send sent one that worked. He's the best:)

Works as it should. It's enough for my needs and handles simultaneous activity on all ports well. Not an unbearable dropoff in performance while say, transferring huge files to an external hard drive, while burning a DVD, and fiddling with the iPod. If you're like me and you need your laptop to do a little more without adding to desk clutter uneccesarily, this should suit you fine

I received this product from an Amazon.com seller for 1/2 the price of what Best Buy was selling it for. It was new and in an unopened box. Upon opening the box I was able to tell right away that it was built very good.  The hinges for the outer antenna sections are very sturdy and once locked in the open position were not going anywhere.  I had spent over $300 for a Runco antenna for my Runco projector for local HD (DirecTV does not have local HD in my area) and even with perfect mounting position outside was only getting at best 80% reception with it.  This antenna with a similar design the the Runco model is built better and I get between 94-98% reception depending on the channel (directional antenna so reception varies slightly).  I was also amazed with the fact that I not only get local channels for Youngstown Ohio, but I also get locals with over 60% reception from Cleveland (direction antenna is facing) but also Pittsburgh (which is on opposite side of house about 60 miles away and in opposite direction antenna is facing).  Great product and no issues with it so far.  The included booster works better than the one built into my DirecTV receiver, so I advise hooking antenna up straight to your ant in on the back of your projector (if it has a built in HD tuner) or TV for best results

I've had mine for 10 months now and it's been very reliable; not one problem with it. It's quick to print out the first page, the display is a monochrome LCD with a backlight so you can see in dark spaces (say, if you keep it under a counter), no paper jams, no nonsense. 

Also, if you're an Apple owner the drivers are already included with OS X; truly plug n print. What's a real treat is to combine it with an Apple Airport Express and use Apple's Bonjour software to easily convert it to a wireless network printer. Bonjour is available for both OS X and Windows computers, and is a breeze to install. 

I highly recommend if you're in the market for a multifuntion monochrome laser printer machine that is compatible with both Windows and Mac OS

I am quiet satisfied with the T10. 
3 cons: 
no reset button, AA battery type (I prefer litium ion) , primitive menu.

3 Pros: 
mp3 + voice record + fm radio
good sound quality
belt clip

Overall success: 80 %

I owned a Bose wave radio for a number of  years. The price was well beyond my financial means, but I made the sacrifice, and I'm very glad I did. The sound defied belief, and  I was very pleased. You will be, too. Forget the detractors herein. They know nothing, like the "reviewer" who listened to AM Radio. If the sound of frying eggs is appealing to you, then, any radio will suffice. But if a clear sound is what you're going for, then go buy a Bose Wave Radio! You'll be glad you did. I know that I am

Bought this to convert PAL Hi-8 (Canon) purchased years ago in Singapore for Mac (PowerBook G4, Tiger OS-X) nonlinear editing. Worked perfectly the first time, only needed to set a single switch to select PAL. No need for software drivers etc. Happily plugged and played with the Mac and the camcorder.

Acceptable price for the features and ease of use.

Installation time was only about 20 min. Hook up the Digital and analog cables, and it configures itself. It took me a while to decide which resolution to use that was best for me, but once I found it, I was really pleased with the size and clarity. Music composition is much easier with the big screen. One small con was the stand is not adjustable, but it fit perfectly into my office space, so I didn't need the adjustment. The video quality on this LCD is amazing.

After enduring the so-so performance of my stock ipod headphones, I figured it was time to step up.  As I travel constantly, I wanted something that would would block out exterior noise; as a music freak I wanted something that would sound great.  After countless hours of research and even more time debating on what brand of headphones to get (UE vs. Shure vs. Etymotics) I bought the Super.fi 5 pros.  In the end it was the price, Amazon was selling then for $90 less than the MSRP. Can't beat that.
As soon as they were delivered I hooked them up and put them on.  They aren't kidding when they tell you to turn your audio device way down.  I keep the volume on my ipod way down, a fraction of what I kept it at with the stock headphones.  The room I was in faces a major road and we had the windows wide open, so to say there was plenty of ambient noise would be an understatement.  With the UEs on, it was just me and the music.  A fire engine thundered by, normally a painfully annoying experience.  Again, the UEs reduced it to the point that I didn't realize the fire engine was coming until I saw it drive by.
As for the music.  I first played a couple of tracks by Jenny Lewis and the Watson Twins.  I immediately noticed elements to the music I never even heard with my other headphones.  Jenny Lewis' angelic voice came through so beautifully clear it was like I was listening to them for the first time.  Next I put on some Ray Charles.  With the UEs, it was like I was there in the front row.  The horn section nearly kicked me out of me chair while I discovered that there was indeed a woodwind section.  I've read complaints that in ear headphones don't produce enough bass, so I decided to see for myself and played a couple of tracks from Siamese Twin by The Smashing Pumpkins.  While I'm not by any means a bass head, I need some bass to enjoy rock albums.  I couldn't have been happier with how the UEs performed.  The drums in the album (which I've always considered some of the best) came alive.  The guitars actually had some balls, but didn't overpower the singing or drums.
As is the case when you stick things in your ears for a period of time, your ears are bound to hurt a little.  I found this to be the case only for a day or two, after that the UEs fit snugly without any complaint.  The only weird thing I encountered had to do with ear wax.  My wife, an audiologist, forbids the family from using Q-tips.  So after taking the UEs off for the first couple of times, there was a nice deposit left on the tips of the headphones.  Like the discomfort, this earwax experience only lasted for the first couple of times I used the UEs, and with the supplied earwax cleaner it was really a non issue.
When there are so many excellent products out there, finding the perfect headphones becomes extremely challenging.  I've never tried on Shures or Etymotics, so I can't compare the performance of those headphones and the UEs.  What I do know is that I got a really great deal on the best headphones I've ever had.  Without a doubt these are the last pair of headphones I will buy for some time.

After looking at $250.00 mounts, I was unsure about order at this low price.  This is a great, well built unit. I would have no problem putting
a 130 lb. unit on it if you follow the enclosed instructions.  Hardware 
for most walls included.  Well painted with no rough edges.  Mine was installed over wall board into wood studs.  I used the awl to make sure I hit the studs dead center. Delivery from New York to Sarasota, Fl. was 5 days.  Can't bet that

Basically, This backpack is all that I need in a back pack. Very well padded, very roomy, fits an HP Pavillion dv8000 17" laptop. Its very attractive and after a month on use shows no signs of ware and tear. Definately worth the $. Unlike my previous packpacks The straps adjust so quickly and easily that I adjust them every time I put the pack on or take it off. Great Product!!!

It's a decent mic for just a few bucks.  It works adequately, and has an on/off switch, and an XLR connector.

It comes with a XLR-to-1/4 cord.  If you're going to plug this mic into a mixer, be sure to get a XLR-to-XLR cord.  The volume of the mic, when connected to a mono 1/4 jack with the included cable, was almost inaudible.  With a XLR-to-XLR cord, it was at normal volume levels compared with other equipment

Never a better caluclator in existance.

Used it all thought Calculus classes and Computer Science. It does everything. Fast, smooth, pretty print flawlessly and more memory then a herd of elephants. Even does 3D graphing excellently. Spherical trig? not a problem at all and fully graph it, slice it up and zoom in.

Also a few sites on hacking the TI-92 Plus that you can google for anyone intrested

This is an AWESOME little device. 

Let me start with the pros: 

1) EASY: Incredibly easy setup (literally press one button - never believed it, but it's true. Plug in the usb transmitter, press the blue button &amp; voila.) 

2) GOOD SOUND: For a small set of speakers, these things sound great. They are not going to compare to speakers hooked up to your rack stereo system, but sound very good and comparable to a $45 two-speaker set of monitor-side speakers. There's a built in sub-woofer that helps as well. 

3) WIRELESS RANGE: With 4 AA batteries, you can carry this little guy around your whole house - and outside your house. Reception is great. I am used to bluetooth headsets that don't really work much further than 10 feet from the phone - I had doubts about bluetooth speakers, but I am amazed with reception these guys have. 

4) CONTROLS: the Forward, Reverse &amp; Pause buttons on the speaker work fine with both Media Player or Yahoo Music Engine running on the laptop(the only two I tried). Again, I was surprised, but they worked flawlessly. 

5) COOL: As far as cool factor, this little guy is definitely that. 

Cons: 

1) NO REMOTE: It would be nice if there was a remote control for the unit that would allow you to control the sound, FF, RW, Pause, Play controls. 

2) NO CONTROL FROM PC: You can't control the sound (or mute) from the laptop - only from the speakers. 

3) SOUND: Above I said the sound was good - and it is considering the size of this system. However, these are small speakers and a mini-sub and the sound is thus somewhat small too. It's good, but it's not going to compare to a quality set of speakers hooked up to your rack stereo system. There is base but not a great deal - you definitely won't feel the music with these speakers. 

4) VOLUME: Volume is limited - it's enough to fill a mid-sized room, but not much more. 

For $100, this is an outstanding little speaker system that does an amazing job with NO WIRES. Carry it to your kid's room. To the garage. To the basement. No wires, nothing. 

If convenience is and portability is important to you, and if medium sound quality is ok, then I would HIGHLY recommend this speaker system. It's great. 

Personally, I'm not sure if I'm going to keep them because I would really like fuller sound (this was an attempt at easy speakers for my living room) and more base - but they're so cool and convenient, that I doubt I'll be able to give them up!

I bought this for my wife. I have an iRiver HP120, which I consider to be one of the best ever made. I have to say, I think this is a great little player. The interface is well designed, the unit is well made, and the sound quality is excellent. I purchased a U2 about 1 year ago as a gift, which was also excellent. I think Cowon is making some of the better MP3 players on the market now, and I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a high quality unit

I've had Canon printers using this cartridge for more than a year and won't settle for any of those knock-offs. Yeah, they're often much cheaper, but this is one area where you get what you pay for. Brand X fades and does not perform as well in the inkjet system. This has been confirmed in independent lab tests in a leading PC magazine. I have had to install and remove countless cartridges and NEVER spilled a drop. The pop-in, pop-out design couldn't be easier

I have really bad luck with head sets (I dropped a vise on my last set, really)these are really well built headphones, it always seems to be the mic or the volume control that goes bad, but on this head set they are all separate so if any one goes out then you still have a good head set. They can get very loud and not crack, exceptional base, and mic is very very clear. They are light but feel solid, although I have not put them to the vise test they seem you be strong. I have very big ears that is one of the reasons I bought this head set, it is very comfortable. The only thing I don't like is that they do not block very much sound because there are holes behind the ear cups, but maybe it help keep your ears cool, maybe. I really give them 4 1/2 stars. I paid about $90 for them and I have no regrets. So if you want a head set to use is a relatively quit environment these are good but if not go for the Sony mdr-300/mdr-400 they don't have mics but good headphones.
Hope this helped, good luck

The quality of this bag is just great the problem could be the very tiny front bag. It also has a small bag for the AC power cable and transformer but once you use it there is no place to put it comfortably considering a 15" laptop

This armband provides good protection to the nano via a skin that the nano slides into and a rigid clear protector that fits over the screen (stays in place by pressure from the skin pressing down on rubberized edges of the protector). 

It works well for jogging and working out. The neoprene (better than leather for sweaty workouts) armband fits well on my upper arm (6' 200lb) and seems pretty adjustable to other size arms. It is a bit awkward to silde the nano into the skin while keeping the screen protector in place. I first began sliding the nano into the armband mount but found that difficult to keep the screen protector in place so I now just clip it in which seems to work fine. It has tried to come loose from the armband a couple of times but I think this was due to not ensuring the nano was fully seated into the armband. 

I have only used the armband for about 3 weeks now and I am satisfied at this point, I am only giving 4 stars due to the screen protector being scuffed out of the package and there could have been better documentation included. Also on another note, apple should have centered the hold button on the top of the nano because almost all protectors I have seen make it somewhat difficult to access the button and this one is no exception. The button is next to the upper left edge and any decent protector has to almost cover this area to work properly. 

All in all you will be satisfied with the armband and remember for the price your are getting a skin for everday protection of the nano and a good armband also so it's a solid value.

I bought these for my Zune after an exhaustive search for a good sounding, compact headphone for work and working out at the gym.

If you are like me and can't stand all the earbuds out there, then you need to find another solution. I tried the Premium Zune buds at 40 bucks, and the Bose Quiet comfort buds at 100 bucks, but they just gave me earaches and I was always fiddling with them to keep them in my ear canal tight. 

I read countless reviews of this headphone and I can say this is the best sounding under $40 headphone out there that won't mess with your hair. (Yes, better than even the Bose earbuds!)
If you are only using the stock buds or phones with your mp3 player, be prepared to be blown away. Tight, full bass range with smooth airy highs and mellow mids. You don't have to crank them either, they sound rich even at lower volumes. But if you do crank them they don't distort at all. If you have ever tried the Bose Quiet comforts at the stores, these sound very similar but with an open air design!

The only negative is the comfort. The little rubbery clips that go behind your ears take some getting used to and can hurt after 30 minutes or so. I think I'll get used to it. I'd much rather deal with a little discomfort on the outer ear vs. jamming an earbud in my ear and getting a sore ear canal (which I had). That could lead to ear infections or other more serious ear problems.

Some other reviewers complained about the headband, but it sounds like they were not wearing these right. Once on your noggin, the band needs rotated up toward you skull in the back till it touches your head. This keeps everything nice and tight and also gives the earclips more space and flexibilty which equals greater comfort. I do not think the headband is too tight, it has the perfect amount of tension to keep these in place.

I might buy a pair of the PX 100's as well just for wearing around the house or lying in bed reading.  The PX 100 is the same exact phone in an "over the head" design. At $40, I can afford to get both

When my CDs started skipping I thought they has seen the last days of spinning, however this Disc Cleaner has solved all problems. You simply put the CD into the cleaner with the label side down. Then, you spray the disc cleaner to the disc surface. You only apply one even spray of cleaner. Then, you close the case and make sure the lid is totally closed. 

Once you have cranked the movable part of the lid about 5 times, you can remove the disc and let it dry completely. Most of the cleaner was absorbed into the cleaning pad after the recommended 5 rotations. I found that 8 or 9 rotations did the trick. 

The first time I used this cleaner I was a bit frustrated with it because I noticed little pieces of black foam all over my CDs. Apparently, there is a little piece of foam in the middle that looks like it belongs there and it seems glued down, but once I removed that piece of foam, all was go. 

This unit comes with one additional cleaning pad. I think if you are just using this to remove fingerprints, you won't have to replace the cleaning pads very often. 

Handy gadget to prolong disc life and restore performance to contaminated disc surfaces.

I purchased 2 for my son and husband. Both rumble and work perfectly with the racing games such as Need for Speed Underground 2, Nascar 2003 and 2004. Some of the early games cannot be used, but they still love it. The wheels actually feel like you are in a race car with realistic resistance. I recommend this item

It works!  The antenna isnt junk either, I am getting almost all the digital stations from chicago 25 miles from sears tower with it inside my house sitting on my desk. I also get many digital channels that happen to be on the comcast analog cable in my area (chicagoland). Problem is that all the analog stations on my comcast cable are untuneable, so I cant watch those on my mac.  Its not supposed to be a cable tuning box, just digital stuff, so its fine, I just thought it did that as well.

next thing to do is get a bigger/better antenna mounted outside and cancel cable (as I only watch a couple stations anyways).

eyetv - works.
cytv with it - works great!  make sure you go and donate to that opensource project

This card is great for the seamless apple look and feel (and only option for internal in imac/ibook/PB) but it is way overpriced now that it is out of production. There are other options. Belkin F5D6050 USB B adapter has drivers for 9.2 and OSX, several manufacturers (e.g. certain Belkin, Linksys, Microsoft) PCI cards have airport extreme chipsets (broadcom) on them that OSX reads as a real airport Xtreme card. You need to do your research and some cards have different chipsets in different revisions, but it is pretty easy overall - and you can save $100

I had been using my air conditioning vents to hold my XM radio and this was recommended to me through a friend.  It's super easy to install and works great.  It doesn't move or shake while driving and is adjustable height wise to fit most car setups.  It was well worth the money and in the summer heat, I am glad I bought it and got my extra air conditioning vent back

The thing that seperates this DVD Case from the rest is it's center lock design. It's secures the disc nicely without damaging it... like I have had others do. Worth the extra dough to have a quality product. (Now if only their memorex's software was as good!

I purchased this USB light/fan combo mainly for the fan.  I'm one of those guys who is a human heater -- always a little warmer than everyone else.  I use this fan when I'm studying in the library, on the computer at a coffee shop or even at home using my laptop at the desk.  It provides a nice little jet of air right at my face which makes me feel cooler all over.  I can even direct it right in front of me and only the nose of the rotor head is visible because when the fan is running, of course, you can see right through the blades.  The fan runs quietly too.  I've had a couple of times when the fan is making a bit of a noise or isn't running a quickly as normal.  I just pop off the rotor head, adjust the blades a bit (they are flexible vinyl and I give them a little twist and a crease to make them more rigid as they sometimes get bent in my carrying case), pop the rotor head back on and it's good as new again.  

While I like this product a lot, I doubt with frequent use that it will last much more than a year but I still think it's well worth it.  My only regret is that I didn't order two or three of these for future back-ups if needed.  

The light works well too.  It does not illuminate the entire keyboard but in a dark setting it does provide enough illumination for the typical user (a hunt and peck typist may be frustrated but I think it may be enough light for that kind of visibility as well) and definitely enough light to read from a book or hard copy document.

I travel overseas a lot for my job. This little power strip is compact and enables you to keep ONE adapter on the end of it to plug into the funky wall plug and then use your "normal" plugs for operating four devices. Most Monster products are terribly overpriced and not worth the money (wires, cables, etc.) but this gizmo rocks

I used to buy those cheap $[...] red laser pointers at gun shows and flea markets, just to have some fun, but the batteries didn't last long enough and the beam wasn't bright at all, not to mention that it made more of an oval dot than round.  I bought this one thinking that it would be really cool because it was green.  I thought the high price tag was pushing it just for a little green dot, but it is much more than I thought it would be.  The beam is clearly visible in the dark and you can even see the dot on the blackest street in the middle of a sunny day.  The range is incredible and makes street signs reflect hreen shimmers!  I love it!  A much better buy than those crappy red ones, and the AAA batteries are easy to replace and last much longer

We used this remote to program a Sony AV-RM3000 remote, but we need more flexibility for our HTPC.  In hindsight, we should have bought a stand-alone IR unit and something like the Girder software.  Or, maybe just an IR wireless keyboard.

This is not a remote for those seeking flexibility, or those who like to customize their media experience.  This is an excellent remote for those who want out-of-the-box usability, and don't want to bother with customization.  It's well-built, and will be exactly what many mainstream users are looking for.

Pros:  Comfortable shape, sensible layout, high-quality feel, reasonably compatible with many programs

Cons:  Doesn't do absolutely everything in every compatible application, only four somewhat-programmable keys with limited option

This Salamander Designs rack is very well made and looks great.  It takes a few hours to assemble, but the result is nicer than most home theater furniture out there.  Unfortunately, Amazon's shipping (via UPS) didn't go so well and the outer box arrived in very bad shape.  I was hoping that the inner box would protect the item, but, alas, one of the two doors was damaged.  I'm now trying to get Amazon to replace the door, but they can only exchange the whole unit.  The shipping box is completely destroyed, so I've been forced to contact the manufacturer directly.  Crossing my fingers..

This TV/Monitor rocks!!  

I've been looking for a combo computer monitor and TV that I could use in my office. This LCD does both very well. I'm writing this review with the LNS4696D installed and everything on the screen is very large (what I wanted) even at 1600x1200 and the resolution is far better than I expected!! (hint: sharpen the image and set high energy saving mode)

Are they the best no.. Do they impress people who havent hear them before YES!! To me thats the best compliment, they are much more objective listeners
with no preconcived notions. All I ever hear is " Those speakers sound so Good" " I love those cool little speakers" etc. I've played everything from Bach to Dio and they sound very realistic. Subwoofer placement is key to having the proper bass level. At [...] they are a steal.. I paid [...]in 1991 and listen to them everyday they still sound like they did when new.

I bought this cooling fan because my computer was shutting off on its own, and the problem seemed to be that the computer was overheating.  While this product hasn't "cured" my computer, the performance of my computer has definitely improved with the use of the cooling fan.  The extra USB ports are convenient as well.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has a laptop and wants to keep it from overheating

I bought this because I needed good phones without the extra bulk.  They're really lightweight, but not flimsy.  They have very good sound quality.  I really like the volume control on the headphones themselves. It gives me the extra level of control.  All in all, a really good bang for your buck

Jensen JM10 Anonymous Review I love these headphones!! The easy access volume control is right where I need it and I can turn it ON and OFF whenever I need to. They are a great value! The headphones stay where they are supposed to and fit my head great. The sound quality is clear and crisp. The single cord attached makes it feel as if your not wearing headphones at all. I would recommend it to all my friends

After reading other reviews i was skeptical of purchasing the dioshield for my IPOD. I had read a lot about how it interefered with the USB cable or the hold switch.  But I couldn't argue with the price.

I must say that this product it actualy one of the best aftermarket IPOD products I have puchased.  It does exactly what it is supposed to do, Protect My Ipod. I have no trouble opperating any of the IPOD's  buttons and I simply remove the case when I charge the unit.  I have not found that it impairs the functionality of the IPOD at all while keeping it securely around my neck.  It is perfect for Jogging weight training and other outdoor activitites.  I find it much less cumbersome than the armband or belt clip units as it does not impede my range of motion.

Ultimately it perfectly protects my IPOD when I am out and about which is what it was designed to do.

The reasons I gave it 4 and not 5 stars was the laniard feels a little short not much but a little. and I whished they had mounted the IPOD right side up like they did on the nano model.

Over all I am well please

For the price, these speakers are well worth the cost. Of course, in my opinion, anything that dosnt say "Creative" on it is usually worth the price. Not a lot of bass, but with the bass boost, these speakers sound real nice. Only bad thing I'll say is that M-Audio's tech department is really bad. Emailed them about a week ago inquiring about driver updates for Vista, still no answer. (my inquiry was about a different m-audio product)

The six commonly used power tips provide flexibility with this product.  I purchased this to use as an interface between a CD Walkman player and the AC power cord.  The heads have specific polarity; so it is possible to attach the heads incorrectly.  However, if you pay attention to the plus and minus hookups as indicated, it's not too difficult to make the attachment correctly the first time.  I found the product to work effectively.  The only negative I can see is that the actual plug-in device is a bit bulky; so if you want to use this in a power strip setting, the AH3WH can be a bit of a plug hog.  However, other than that limitation, the product was reliable.  Recommended to save on those batteries which do add up

I have been putting this television through its paces since I got it a few weeks ago, and it is by far the best TV I have ever owned, and very difficult to beat.  The image quality is really good, with bright, vivid colors and wonderful detail, especially for 1080i/p content, but even lower-resolution 720p content, which is what's more commonly-available on OTA HD broadcast, looks phenomenal.  I also have an Apple TV hooked up to it, and even though most of my content is encoded at either 360p, 480p, or 720p, it still looks quite good.

It does take some time to get the image tuned to perfection, and the default settings are way too bright with too much color saturation boost, and the DNIe processing system actually seems to make some motion effects worse.  However, it's very easy to change the settings and see immediately what effect they have.

Like all LCDs it does have some slight black point problems; these aren't noticeable for fullscreen 16:9 content, but for older 4:3 content it's pretty obvious that the black isn't pure black.  However, this is again tunable.

The only thing I really notice which is pretty annoying is that it doesn't do a very good job of upscaling 480i content, such as the output from most video game systems, and for DVDs to look good you really need an upconverting player since even with a progressive-scan player there is a lot of visible pixelation when the 480p content is scaled up.  It's really more a sad reflection on how the previous "next-generation" video looks downright primitive by today's standards.

The other noticeable issue is that unlike many televisions with digital tuners, it doesn't have an on-screen program guide.  My previous TV (also a Samsung) had an on-screen program guide, but it was rather cumbersome to use and took several minutes of scanning every channel to see what was on, and most local channels are pretty inconsistent about providing the EPG information anyway, so it's not really that big of a deal.  You can still see the detailed information for the program that's currently showing, so it makes use of EPG, just not as much as it could.

This television's tuner is also quite phenomenal.  My previous TV required a very carefully-positioned powered antenna which was very sensitive to every little nearby fluctuation, while with this one I only have a piece of wire jammed into the antenna port and I get perfect reception of every local digital station.

Another nice improvement over Samsung's older HDTVs is that it has a wide variety of zoom modes which allow you to counteract some of the stupider things that TV stations do (for example, pillboxing a letterboxed 16:9 show, which is very common for widescreen non-HD programming).  Also, analog TV stations and source inputs get their audio signals upconverted to digital, so you only need to run a single optical audio connection to your stereo (while previous Samsungs required running both analog and digital cables and switching between the two inputs based on source material).

As a PC monitor this is also quite nice.  I have a Mac mini hooked up via SVGA cable, and even with an analog signal it looks perfectly sharp and crystal-clear, and of course you can hook it up via HDMI (with a DVI to HDMI adaptor) as well.  The only gripe there is that the supported resolutions are a bit quaint - at least on analog SVGA the only 16:9 resolution it supports is 1920x1080, which can be difficult for some older systems to handle.  However, on HDMI it should support all the standard HD resolutions.

This television may be more expensive than others in its size class, but it also far outshines every other TV I have seen, aside from the newer LN-T4065, which is nearly identical aside from providing a higher dynamic contrast ratio.  If you want to only buy one TV which will last for a long time, it would be hard to go wrong with this one

I just added this to my Onkyo HTIB system and it's made all the difference in the world. I'm a bit of an audiophile (on a reasonable budget), with four subwoofers scattered throughout the rooms in my house and one 10" Polk in my truck. I'm most satisfied with the Polk subwoofers for their tightness and ability to pound low frequencies without turning the sound into a boomy mess. I listen to a lot of music with double-bass drumming and thought that this PSW12 would have a tough time keeping up with the quickness of the 10" sub I like so much. Not the case. What I get is very quick bass with that ground-shaking impact that I always look for.

I'm still going easy on 'er for the break-in period, but I can say that the trailer for Kingdom of Heaven (included on the Blu-Ray disc) sounds absolutely stunning. Paired with my 57" Sony HDTV, trips to the movie theater are few and far between these days. Now is a great time to pick up one of these, since the price seems to have recently dropped by about $50 throughout the web.

Unbeatable sub for the money!

The only thing I don't like about it, is the scanning area is upside down where most scanners you open the lid and put your photo or document close to you this scanner you have to put it all the way to the back of the scanner so you have to open the lid all the way. Also the film tray shows on some of my documents as well you would think they would give you something to cover the film tray when not in use. I did like the way XP found this scanner right away with no disks or software. I have a cannon scanner I just got a few months ago but it is limited because it is not compatible with XP with out cannons software, The cannon was so bad that I purchased this one all in all I like it does a great job glad they still make just scanners for people who use laser printers

I'm a fanatic for duplexing since I move a LOT of paper around, sometimes amounts which I have to carry to court or mail and which weigh several pounds.  The Brother is one of the better machines for the price that handles duplexing well, maybe even the best.  

This particular machine has wireless G built-in, but it costs over $100 more than the same machine without wireless, and for well over $100, you can probably manage to do the same thing cheaper, maybe even better, and for my office, wireless is inappropriate.  (It also should be stated that if you go outside Briother itself, then the wireless combo IS cost-effective.  Brother essentially competes here only with itself.)  

That said, it makes for an elegant solution in the home if you have any sort of barrier to wiring and would like a single piece of equipment to handle everyone's printing if several of you are running off of a wireless router.  There are a bevy of bonuses if this machine is otherwise appropriate for you.  It's a complete standalone fax/copier if someone in the house doesn't even have any computer at all.  I'm a long-time Brother customer, and they've made operation more intuitive for both computer users and standalone.  There were a few bugs in earlier machines by Brother (comparable but older machines I've owned, like the 8500 and the 9700) such as faulty out-of-toner warnings, and all of these seem to have been worked out.  This machine is clearly out of beta.  

Earlier machines were difficult (though not impossible) to set up and use advanced functions without using your manual, and this machine is far better on that aspect as well.  You can have faxes arrive two-sided, which doubles your paper tray effectively, and you can scan or fax a two-sided document just by feeding it in and possibly altering a setting.  This last is made possible by the physical arrangement and just as much by the aforementioned ease-of-use - you wouldn't use the feature much if you had to do major messing around with menus just send out a two-sided page.  

Unfortunately, the one bane of all printers which is slightly worse with the Brothers is the "ink" aspect.  Unlike some competitors, you have to replace a toner AND a drum, and at differing intervals. I assume they do this to keep the costs low, but the costs still aren't particularly low.  The non-wireless version of the basic machine sells for a little over $400, and there is no problem spending that much for just a couple of drums and a few toners.  I don't understand why printers of all sorts cannot just have a "gas tank" you could fill with cheap ink and then just add paper, but in most instances, the consumables are the tail wagging the dog in terms of buying a printer.   The Brother is a superbly-functioning modern machine at a great price, but don't imagine the price ends when you buy it.  This is true of all printers, however, and the news with most printers is worse than here

I can't say enough about the Tivoli AM/FM radio!  It has superior sound and i love the design of the case as well.  Some folks might be hesistant to spend over $100 for a radio ... trust me - it is well worth it.  My girlfriend's parents have had an older version of this radio for over 30 years - still sounds great

I would encourage ANYONE in the market for a shredder to first identify WHERE the machine is to be placed! If you want something "cute" and compact, then, keep looking. This SB-97Cs is a work horse, in every sense of the word. Consequently, it may not appeal to one's feminine traits. Although the size can be a bit formidable for home use, it's power and relatively quiet operation set the standard for all others. I was surprised at just how quiet it was! The controls are easy to master, and the safety features are good to have for the occasional inquisitve child. Having had a lessor (un-named) shredder, I knew that my shredding needs were beyond the waste-paper-basket sized machines for less money. Being one who regularly shreds credit card "bait" checks, and other sensitve info that accumulates through the years, this SB-97Cs shredder was a must have. I doubt that I'll outgrow this machine. I've had this shredder for only a couple of months now, and I expect to have it for many years to come. It IS NECESSARY to oil the cutters after each full basket, though. If you are the disciplined and conscientious type, this is not a problem. However, I can see the lifespan of this machine being cut short by the negligent types who don't read instructions..

This product has worked great with my 2Wire Gateway modem from AT&amp;T Yahoo.

The real plus has been the USB connection so its not necessary to take off the desktop's back panel. 

The connection has been good, and I set it up in minutes.

I tend to think that people who are having connection problems have a problem with their router, and not this device.  I can see 50%+ networks from all over my neighborhood

Switch was simple to install to my existing network, just plug and go. I used this switch to separate some CPUs off of the 100mb network and put them on the gig highway. Worked just as planned and was seamless. I actually added two of these and saved big jack over a 16 port gig switch. Network speed and response time increased even for those CPUs w/out a gig nic. I like the idea of having a switch with capacity that far exceeds network traffic. Highly recommend

While the two fans I ordered for a new computer build are functioning properly, they are not as advertised on Amazon's website.  According to the specs on the site, they have a double ball-bearing design which last longer than normal fans. Be warned, these are NOT the Antec double ball-bearing fans, but the less expensive ones.  Have contacted Amazon and hope they update the specs to reflect these accurately

I took my MP3 player into the store with me to check out earbuds.
Eveyone I tried was terrible; so I ended up buying online.

I read all the reviews, especially Amazon reviews; because the people know what they are talking about.

I have bought 5 pair altogether for friends, and they love these buds too.

The music I listen to ranges from Tupac to Vivaldi, and everything in between. My MP3 player has 9 EQ settings; I keep it on new age most of the time. 
The price is right, and the sound is the best.

A lot of TV for little money.  Great picture, and the refresh rate is fast enough to prevent most of the blurring that you tend to see on low end LCD's.  Initial setup can be tricky because Olevia chose to include a CD version of the operators manual, though you can print a paper version from the CD or Olevia website.  Better than average sound, but the side speakers add a bit to the overall width.  After tweaking the factory settings we achieved a nice color balance without any of the black level problems that plague many LCD's.  If you're using it in a bedroom you'll most likely be annoyed by the very bright on/off light on the front panel.  Rear panel connections are intuitive and easily accessible, and wall-hanging was a breeze.  Looked at many LCD televisions and there are better choices for sure, but it's hard to beat the performance of this set at the low price. Highly satisfied!

I had great hope for this product.  It has, mostly, so far, lived up to my expectations.  Here are some caveats...

I was hoping for the ability to set up music catagories...easy listening, dinner music, light jazz...etc.  You have to "cheat" to do this, and using the manual is daunting.  Instead of using the "Artist" as artist, I used it as a catagory code, ie making one artist light jazz, etc.  This works, but you do, of course lose the artist registration ability.

So now, I can select "artist" "Dinner Music" and then "All Discs" and "Shuffle", and the unit will play a track from one "Dinner Music" CD then shuffle to another track on another "Dinner Music" CD, etc, making a delightful, mix of music that never is repeated exactly the same way.

I am still in the loading phase of coexistance with this machine, so longetivty, and flawlessness are not being reviewed here.  That remains to be seen.

The manual is purely awfull.  Just dig in and try things.  That's the only way to get a handle on things.  Hope this helps....good luck!

I received this printer a few days ago and I am very impressed. 4 X 6 photos look awesome as if I had Walmart print them and the speed is very fast. I hook it up to my Airport Extreme Base Station (I use a Powerbook) and print wirelessly and had no problems at all. Scanner is a tad bit noisy but a lot quieter than my old HP All in one printer that just kicked the bucket.

The software is easy to use and understand. I never read the directions and I was scanning in pictures with in minutes. I also like the LCD display on the printer. Its nice to just "pop" in a memory card, and view the photos you want to print. It saves time when you don't have to download them to the computer then print them.

Overall I am vey pleased and I did my search on this printer and all of the reviews were very good. I was torn between Canon (I actually bought a Canon Pixma and returned it) and HP and I am glad I stuck with HP, always a trusted brand. And the price was about $40.00 dollars cheaper than any electronics store around.

Pros:
Excellent picture qualty
Fast printing
Easy setup
A lot of features
Easy to use and understand functions

Cons:
Scanner a litte noisy (quieter than my old HP)
When printing the printer shakes my table (old HP did the same)
I guess it is a little on the large side, but it doesn't bother m

I have just up-graded to a 40" HD samsung 1080p TV so I had to replace my 2 yr old onkyo 601 "great receiver" with this 674 model mainly for the HDMI switching capabilities, set-up was a little tricky but after an hour I was ready to try the audyssey set up mic. which was very straight forward &amp; accurate Boy was I blown away. This thing has such clarity &amp; separation I couldn't believe the difference over my older onk.rec.I have direct TV hd-dvr &amp; Panasonic 1080i DVD player via HDMI through receiver, don't waste your money on those over priced monster cables, all of mine are 15-20 bucks from amazon. I am so pleased with my purchase I also feel this is a great value 599.00 I know their is not a better receiver out there at this price or even for 200.00 more. I would highly recommend this as the backbone to any quality home theater system. I read another review that expressed that you couldn't turn it up past 60,that is false I can crank mine up to max with with vertually no distortion

I recently purchased the Pacific Breeze Laptop Cooler and so far am very impressed with it.  Now this review should be taken with a grain of salt, because I have only had the cooler for a few weeks, but I feel that the results were evident immediately and the build does seem adequate.  The reason that I was in search of a cooler was due to my dangerously hot hard drive temps.  I installed Notebook Hardware Control (free temperature and power control utility) after feeling how hot my new notebook was getting and saw temps as high as 55C at my hard drive!  Worried about how this would affect the hard drive's longevity, I started looking around at coolers.

I choose this cooler after reviewing several of the "mat" variety, but chose this one because of its design.  As the previous reviewers have already mentioned, this cooler elevates the notebook from the rear and blows air under the notebook.  This allows the CPU fan intake and hard drive to receive plenty of fresh air.

After setting this cooler up, I was feeling pretty good about the purchase.  Qualitatively, the results are evident by a cooler notebook top and keypad, and the feel of air exiting the sides of the notebook.  Quantitatively, the notebook experienced a 5C temperature drop at my HD and at my CPU.  Now my hard drive is running at 40C-45C instead of 45-50C!
I would definitely recommend this product

Unlike the first reviewer my experience with Trigger Finer has been a good one. At first it took me awhile to figure out how to get the device to control the drums in Impulse (Ableton Live) once I realized that each pad had to be set in order to have each tone mapped it was a breeeze. I suspect that maybe the first reviewer as well as any midi newbie might have difficulty in that respects since it is not plug in play as M Audio states....it is program and play, however once you get it programmed correctly it is effortless. The htinkg is it is soo expandable and programmable it may be to its own detriment especaiily for peolle who are not fimiliar with mapping out midi controllers

We looked at many TV stands to go with the Sony TV we were buying.  Only a few were worth considering, but finally decided to go with the Sony unit designed for our specific TV.  Am I glad we did!  It has hold downs to secure the TV and the cable straps at the rear are easy to use and make the installation clean and clear.  Very nicely designed, along with being good looking

Wow, I'm surprised by the reviews made here about this product. Despite the bad reviews, I bought it anyway.  I still believe in a Motorola.  Guess what?  Not bad.  I bought this phone set and 4 of its satellites to replace my Siemens.  The Siemens was the best phone when it first came out about 5 years ago.  This Moto phone has the features most people will ever need.  The shared phonebook is very valuable.  A loud speakerphone on each handset is priceless.  Incoming and outgoing sound quality is excellent.  I don't understand why there are several reviews here stating the phone has bad sound quality.  Ok, the range is not as good as my 2.4ghz phone but it is not bad for someone with an average size home.  After about 75 meters with 3 walls in between, I can start to hear the voice I'm speaking to, crackles.  I just did this for test but I can get clear voice anywhere in my 4 bedroom house.  I am running a 2ghz wi-fi and do not hear any interference. With regard to the phonebook, I wish I can enter more characters each address!  The maximum characters I can enter is only 11.  I think I can enter about 20 on my Siemens.  Another minor quirk is when someone called, I could just lift the phone off its charging base and start talking to the other party.  Not with this phone.  I still have to press the "flash" bottom everytime before I can start talking.  Build quality is excellent.  It is a little on the heavy side which I like probably because it uses 4 rechargeable batteries and made of thick plastic.  Even if I squeeze the handset hard, I didn't hear that plasticky noise and feeling of the plastic warping.  I tried the Pana, V-Tech, Uniden, GE, and ATT in a local store and the Motorola is tops. You will not see a rubbery wiggly buttons here.  I personally think this is the best phone among the few remaining brands around.  If you do not see it that way, it must be a quality defect that can happen on any product.

This radio has excellent features for someone who is either new to shortwave radio or just wanting a simple, user-friendly set of controls.  Also perfect for those that like analogue-style controls that would be encountered on older radios.  I have the S-350, the model that the S-350DL replaces.  For general world band programme listening, this radio is fantastic.  Outstanding speaker.  Easy to read digital display includes backlight.  Includes attenuator.  Clock can be set to 24 hour time.  Easy to carry anywhere.  Robust antenna.  Does not support SSB tuning, which you would need to tune in Ham radio.  Same radio sold under Tescun name in other parts of the world

I don't know what was wrong w/ the other reviewers machine, but let me assure you, this is NOT an inferior product. I got it on Clearance @ Target for $69.98. I have been looking for a long time for a good portable DVD player. I have used it and had NO problems with it whatsoever. Plus if anything does happen in the first 90 it is fully returnable to Target. Good Deal all around. Highly reccomended.

Below is my experience with this product after owning it for 2 weeks.

Pros:
-----
1. Amazing sound especially when watching DVD movies
2. Very good progessive scan DVD picture quality
3. Simple, compact and all-in-one design
4. Remote control can work with various TV's, Cable boxes and VCR's
5. Can play both NTSC and PAL DVD's

Cons:
-----
1. Expensive
2. No HDMI output
3. Non-intuative remote control
4. No headphone jack


Overall, I love and chose the Bose 321 because of the sound quality and compact design. I got this system because I wanted a compact all-in-one media center and I was not interested in getting a HTIB with 5 speakers. I looked at Denon (2 products), Sony and Samsung.

I use this on my 23" Samsung LCD TV using Monster component video cables and while I would have preferred to take advatange of its HDMI capabilties, the reality is that I am very happy with this image quality. Movies such as Lord of the Rings, The Matrix and Hero look and sound fantastic. Prior to this I was looking at the Sony DAV-X1 which is much cheaper and more feature-rich. However the internal turmoils between their consumer electronics and media divisons convince me this would not work for me. For example, my PAL DVDs cannot be played on the Sony whereas on the Bose it was no problem. I am of the opinion that Sony is a directionless company and this is reflected in their products.

To be fair you do need to have the right kind of room to take advantage of their TrueSpace 2.1 surround sound feature. My couch is up against the wall with the media center located 12 ft in front of me. According to Bose the speakers should ideally be 3 feet away from the TV. Sometimes TrueSpace works and sometimes I can't hear it. I believe this is true among all the other competitors in this market line and that neither one stands out ahead of the other. If surround sound is really that important to you, then you should get a 5.1 system. This product is perfect for a small room as it takes advantage of the echos of the room where it can fake a 3D sound and would probably not be ideal for a family size rec-room.

The audio quality from music CD's is very good and while I wish this had an iPod port as found on the Denon, I am very content using the Aux port

     My [...] girl and [...] boy both love their players. The [...]really likes the Sonic games and the ability to connect it to the TV. On a TV the 8 bit graphics are jagged but he does not care and the games are playable. The builtin screens are a little low in resolution if you look closely but cartoons look good and the kids have not noticed anything. 
     The players have a nice lock feature to disable the controls so that the movie is not accidentally stopped. They have both dropped the players serveral times and they both continue to work well. The only problem is that the [...] had figured out how to remove the battery pack. She does this at times then gets upset the movie stopped.
     The players come with everything, AC and auto adapters, a remote control, earphones, built-in stand, battery pack and the wires to play the movies and the games directly on an a TV with RCA jacks

It is my first wireless mouse, so I have nothing else to compare it to, but i definitely like it a lot better than my old mouse.

I needed this cable to use with my Garmin Rino 120 because my new laptop didn't have a serial adapter. My first try was to use a similiar product from Radio Shack, but I found the Radio Shack product was very confusing to use and was unstable.  I ordered the CP Technologie product from Amazon and it worked great! Also, the CP Tech product was less than half the cost of the Radio Shack product (including shipping)

I wanted a simple printer so I could print a few prints from time to time to hand out. On sale for $50, this seemed like the right one. 

I already had the included Zoombrowser and Photo Stitch software installed from my prior purchase of a Canon A95 camera, so I just needed to install the driver. Note this requires a USB cable (not included) to the printer.

As is human nature, I tried to print without reading the Zoombrowser instructions, and got a lovely plain sky-blue print with the words "My Album" on it - but no photo :-) Then, out came a stunning second print which was totally blank but with some faint horizontal lines - this was from a residual click from my first attempt. Ok, Ok, so I looked at the PDF printing guide for about 15 seconds, and followed the instructions.

Got a beautiful first print of the Queen Mary ship. Got a gorgeous second print of flags (red/white/blue, and green) againt a clear blue sky, and the third print was very nice of a field of flowers near Mt Lassen (ironically the original proof print of this from 20 years ago was scanned onto my computer just today to get rid of paper prints...)

So, I've blown through the provided "trial" 5 sheets of paper and film cartridge, and have 3 very nice prints (with postcard address lines, stamp area and Canon logo on the back - the paper comes that way.) The ends of the paper remain white but have perforations about 1/2 inch from the end so you can remove them after printing.

I can't compare the printing software to any other brand, but setting up a plain photo-only print takes about 10 seconds of menu choices. If you want to add backgounds, titles/text, etc, that is available as well. (Got another pack of paper/film, and put humorous captions on kind of funny-bad office Christmas pix...)

Printing directly from my A95 takes about the same time as from the computer - about 1 min 45 sec.

The actual operation involves the paper being passed in and out of the printer 4 times (3 color passes and a protective layer) so it is important the back of the printer is not obstructed, particularly by the power cord which hangs down near the edge of the slot. The finished print is deposited on top of the paper cassette in front.  

The unit looks and feels substantial for its small size, comes well packed (survived NY to CA shipping), has decent documentation, and a 1-year warranty.

Every house should have a Grundig S350 Deluxe. Big, brawny, "grabbing" in all the hard-to-get stations with ease, championing a big antenna that says this radio means serious business, the Grundig S350 Deluxe version, is a bigger, better version of the old Grundig S350, eliminating some of the "drift" problems of the earlier model. The speaker on the Deluxe is bigger and brighter. Whereas your fancy digital preset radios often sound like tin, the Grundig S350 DL has depth. Is it a perfect radio? No. You don't have presets in spite of the digital read-out. You get a little AM overload. Here in Los Angeles I get overload on 1150 so that I'm listening to two shows at once. Also the cheaper (and cheaper built) GE Superradio boasts an internal AM ferrite antenna twice the size and as a result gets slightly better AM.

If you're looking for a radio with similar features as the Grundig S350 DL but erases its weakness--no presets and AM overload, then you might want to check out the Grundig G4000A. It's the same price as the S350 and its speaker is surprisingly good for a digital preset shortwave radio. Or you might look at the stunning Kaito 1103 or its more expensive cousin the Eton E5. But even if you get a fancy preset radio, every house should have the big easy-to-use Grundig S350 Deluxe.

Update: Comparing the S350 to the same-priced G4000 for several months, it becomes clear that the G4000 is a better buy: superior AM, superior separation of AM stations, presets, same warm speaker, and smaller.

I must admit I read many other reviews of this item and was a little apprehensive, however... .  I found this recorder to be outstanding in all the items I've tried so far. I initially just hooked it up like my old one was and left it for a few hours after manually setting the time (before reading the instructions) . This made things more difficult so I started over, set it for everything to be automatic, including the time, left it until the next evening and allowed it to do its' thing - which it did magnificently. EVERYTHING worked beautifully and it did a great job. I LOVE the one-touch recording. I found it's best to read directions one at a time as I want to try something new and have had no problems. So far I haven't tried everything it will do but find it's very intuitive and not a bit frustrating to use. It's a joy to hit the TVGuide button, highlight the shows I want to watch and hit the record button. So far I have no complaints

For this price these are a steal! Purchased mine for $15 (with shipping) and let me tell you, it was worth it! The headphones come with a 1/4 converter too! So you can use them for cd players and amps! The sound quality is good, and the headphones don't hurt half as much as other ones after wearing for several hours. These are an amazing deal for the price, I'm honestly surprised these arn't marked for $50. Don't pass these up if your looking for decent quality headphones

I live in an apartment building and play ( well, practice is a better word ) the bass guitar and needed headphones so I wouldn't bother neighbors or my wife whom sleeps and watchs TV about 6 feet from where I sit and play.

The 10 foot long cord was perfect for distance for sitting or standing and moving around while playing, so I wouldn't have to use an extention cable ( and usualy end up with feedback/distortion associated to an unshielded connector in an extention cable)

The volume control on each earpiece lets me adjust the volume so I don't have to mess with my amp or guitar volume settings I like to use when not using headphones.  Makes it real nice too when using an instructional CD or DVD i can turn the bass sound off in one ear to hear the instructions clearly witout needing to seriously skew the headphones off my head.

Very light weight.  Some headphones can weight the head down making you feel like one of them 'bobble heads'.  Fits firmly on the head without any pinching or binding anywere.  

Cord enters headphones on the left ear side, so you don't have to deal with the classic 'Y' split cord.  Easy to flip to the side or drape over the back out of the way.

Earpices fit nicly over my ears (no pinching, gouging or squishing with plenty of clearance around the ear) and does a very nice job blocking out noise ( when my wife is awake she watchs the TV, rather loudly, which is right next to me and I bairly notice it). Plenty of padding around the ear pieces.   Many headphones inside near the ear has hard plastic between the ear and speaker which usualy digs into the ear, but these headphones I honestly don't feel anything against my ears.  Even after several hours of use each night.

Sound quality.  Bose or pioneer they are not, but then if you wanted such high quality you wouldn't be shopping in the $20 and under headphones :)
That being said they are very good for sound.  Sounded very good on a portable CD player.

Only drawbacks I can see is that a person with large/tall ears won't get thier ears covered by the earpads.  The inside opening of the earpads is aprox 2 1/4 inchs tall by 1 3/4.  IMO they could have been made bigger.
Also, if you have a tall head ( good distance from top of head to ear ) you may find fully extended the headphones might not reach your ears.

I have a head like Drew Carry ( give you an idea head size/shape I'm talking about) and if the extension to each earpiece would have been any shorter they wouldn't have fit.

I wear glasses as well by the way and the headphones don't interfere, bind, pinch or anything like that with my glasses.

So, I highly recomend them if low cost headphones is what you are after( I don't recomend things often :) )

Still embarking on spooling off all the Hi-8 tapes I have, but I've been VERY satisfied with the Plextor unit so far.  First thing I did was to spool one Hi-8 tape and then make a DVD, using the functionality of the bundled WinDVD Creator software.  Good news: it worked, and a few hours after I started, I was watching the DVD I created, on my bedroom DVD player.  Bad news: the software is full of minor and sometimes more than minor annoyances.  It may be that I'm still climbing the learning curve with it, but I think it's just not very good.  I'm looking into other solutions, such as Pinnacle, Adobe Premiere Elements, etc.  Meanwhile, I keep spooling.

I haven't yet tried the TV capture in any depth.  It looked like it worked, but again, with some annoyances on the software side.  Plextor could improve this offering vastly with the addition of some better bundled software

I bought these for some Sony surround sound speakers, although I was initially concerned about the choice because they are made from what is(essentially) plastic.  However, they turned out to be very sturdy, and easy to install.  I also have to commend the mannufacturer for including very detailed instructions as well as a large selection of mounting hardware.  Well worth the price

They are good for the price. They have a very good sound quality, or at least better than the ones that came with my Sony Walkman DEJ001. The only problem I had is when I connected them to my older Philips player, it had a low volume output. And then again, even on the Sony player, I had to have the volume at 7, and it only goes to 9. If you have a high output player or a computer, these will be great, but if your using them for a low output or old device, these probably won't cut the cheese

The reviewer below identifying himself as "An Electronics Fan" obviously has a deep bias against Bose.  His multiple reviews about Bose products--here and elsewhere--are transparently motivated by some animus against Bose.  Was he fired by Bose? Did a member of the Bose family reject his romantic advances?  Did a Bose executive accidentally run over his cat?  Did he drop a Bose speaker on his foot and hurt his toe? The true motivation for this guy's negative reviews would be fun to know.  In the meantime, what we do know is that he has no credibility, and his reviews (two here, others elsewhere for other Bose products; he's made maligning Bose his life's work, apparently)) should disregarded.

I bought a set of black 301's several years ago to go with my Onkyo receiver.  We have it hooked up to a television and DVD player for movies.  These speakers are in constant use both for the DVD and for music of all types.  The room in which they are placed is huge, with an 18 foot-high flat ceiling.  The speakers saturate the room with exquisite sound day after day. The speakers work fine for spoken audio for DVD's; we can hear dialogue perfectly; I feel no particular need for a surround-sound system. Several times my young daughters have turned on the 100 watt amp with the volume turned all the way up or close thereto. I feared a ruptured speaker cone, but the 301's are very forgiving, no damage has been done. The cats sleep on the speakers; they clean right up and still look new after five years.  These speakers keep on giving total satisfaction, and I quite simply love them.

About three years ago I decided to go all out in another room and bought the highest quality stereo stuff on the market, or at least what I determined to be best after a lot of research. This included a set of the gold-series tower speakers from Monitor Audio. (The speaker cones are metallic, with some amount of gold, and gold connections, etc., etc.) These Monitor Audios have to be the best looking speakers ever made (real wood veneer cabinetry, with the gold cones and the black covers, etc.). These speakers cost well over a thousand dollars each.  Well, I must confess, as awesome as the Monitor Audios sound, I can't really say they sound any better than the Bose 301's!!! They can maybe handle more power, but I assure you the Bose 301's will play loud enough to bring the cops to your doorstep in five minutes or less.

So, when I recently set up my third stereo in a bedroom, I looked forward to buying a third type of speakers.  I ran around and listened to what I could find on display.  Well, after much contemplation, I went for a second set of the Bose 301's!!!  They just couldn't be beat, and I would have gladly spent more if I had found something I liked better. But I'm not going to spend more just so I can say I spent a lot...there has to be increased performance. And, in my opinion, the 301's couldn't be out-performed by any other bookshelf speaker of any price range. 

My first set of 301's were black.  This time I went for the cherry. Folks, these are absolutely beautiful speakers: almost as cool looking as my Monitor Audios.  The black cover and the black housing fixture in the back really accentuate the cherry colored wood. No, it is not real wood, but it looks very nice.  These things are simply gorgeous. The kind of "mod" or futuristic shape which Bose has designed really stands out in this lighter-colored version.  And, yes, they sound just as good as my original pair.  I listen to soft music (jazz, typically, or ambient) in the morning and these speakers deliver all the nuances at very low volume; I listen to hard rock at high volume on other occasions, and the 301's don't scare away or distort at all: these things would tear the house apart before they'd lose sound quality.

So, yes, I recommend these highly.  They'd still be the speaker of choice for me at three or four times the price

I have two iPods that don't work.  I bought a shuffle first and that has an error that I can't fix and Apple can't fix.  So, I thought I'd buy 1GB iPod a year later and that broke down even with a new computer.  So, this time I made the right decision and bought the 30 GB Zune.  Wow!  The Zune is so much better!  It has such a better feel to it and the controls react nicely, instead of making you frustrated like the iPod.  The screen is perfect.  Sound quality is excellent.  5 Stars for the Zune.

I liked this charger so much that I ended up ordering a second unit. Premium solid performance in addition to 3 years warranty! I called Lenmar company since the fan on the second charger did not work out of the box but guess what, they sent me another charger without hussle! The call took about 2 minute and the replacement part was already on its way, they definetly stand by and back up their warranty. No problems with the second unit and If I ever need another one I would still buy a lenmar. The two middle charging slots supposed to work only on lenmar PPRO-H batteries, one can use the slot number 1 and 4 for regular NiMH batteries, it charges regular high capacity batteries to an 80% level in less than 15 minutes, and the other PPRO-H batteries in about 7-8 minutes. I didn't notice difference between my rechargeable energizer batteries and the the PPRO-H batteries, but the PPRO-H kind are more durable. This charger is the best in its category because it support worldwide voltage 110-240 V and the first to use NeoTherm? charging technology! it's solid and heavy duty charger, not like the cheap kind that are everywhere. I went through lots of sony chargers but you know what? They will never see my money again! the sony chargers are crappy and fry a lot, I have been using the MSC815 since October 2005 almost daily and never once I had an issue with it

This is the perfect little tv/dvd for a little girl's room! The picture is great and Hello Kitty pops on screen for certain commands (volume, channel change..). My daughter age 4 loves it. I would have given this product 5 stars but there are a couple drawbacks...the remote control is has SO many buttons and they are VERY tiny, very close together. I can barely read what each button does because the labels/print is also VERY tiny. This is annoying when in my daughter's darkened room and I have to turn on a bright light just to find the pause button... the other thing I have to point out that bugs me is that you can't eject/or open the dvd player unless the tv is in dvd mode. In other words when I go to put in a dvd, I can't just push "open". Nothing will happen. You have to find the right button, choose "dvd" from a choice of 3-4 things, and only then will the tray slide open. All in all, these things would not prevent me from buying this tv again...although it would be nice if they did come out w/ a more kid friendly remote with bigger buttons/symbols for a small child to recognize... One great thing I want to point out--there is fast forward scan that you can watch as it fast forwards (something not all dvd players offer) and this is great when you are putting a dvd in for your child and they want to skip all those pre-movie ads....you can FF right to the beginning of the movie!!!

I love the feel of this gamepad...after trying several others this is the best. The wireless works ok, i was 20 feet away and it was working.The batteries are what needs improving according to many posts. I thought i had a dead battery but it ended up being a bad connection inside. With a small screwdriver pushed up through the bottom can take apart the battery case. on the positive side of each battery there are two small pieces of plastic. you just need to push these down so the battery has a better chance of connectiing. i also found new batteris at interstate battery store, 1 dollar each. The analog sticks could be a little tighter, but i like the d pad. wireless is great

This compact mini was exactly what we needed to use as a server for our photography studio. All computers can pull from it with no noticible slow down. It was the smoothest install and network to our 6 computers. I will buy another very soon to use as a backup to the first

Garmin has great ideas that suffer from the company they belong to.  This option is a great thing to add to your 305 if you spin indoors or want to increase the accuracy of the GPS.  NOW if only the software was smart about how and when to use the Sensor ...

This Sharp electronic dictionary is the perfect pocket companion for those times when you don't have your laptop, or a dictionary handy.  The interface is intuitive and the keyboard is amongst the best I've ever used on this type of device.  Moreover, the access times for Dictionary and Thesaurus lookups are very fast; the "phrase search" function is a little bit slower, but not intolerable.  There are also "crossword puzzle" and "anagram solver" functions that I have not used, but I imagine work fine.  Another positive for this product is the fact that it uses a single AAA battery, not some watch-type cell battery.

The only negative is that it does not have a backlight for the screen, but neither do many of the other comparable dictionaries.  Hopefully Sharp will smarten up and put that in a future version of the PW-E550.  

I believe this is BY FAR the best electronic dictionary you can get for less than $100, and no, I do not work for Sharp Electronics

Our Oskar Multimedia Storage Cabinet arrived in a timely manner and was in very good condition. My husband assembled the unit with ease, until it was time to nail the card board backing on. Following the instructions he laid the unit down on it's face, of course the kick-board had already been added so it didn't lay flat. When nailing on the backing the "J" board (the center shelf holding the entire unit together) split at every point of contact.

We had ordered our Oskar Storage Cabinet through Amazon, directly from Ritz Camera. So, naturally I called Ritz to replace the "J" shelf. I was informed I would have to return the entire unit. I immediately pictured myself trying to get all those shelves back into the box and figured that was more trouble than I wanted to go through.

So, I tracked down the number for Oskar and called them directly. They were very efficient and helpful. Within minutes I had their assurance that they would ship a new "J" shelf to my home - at no additional charge. The shelf arrived within the promised ten-days.

This unit was exactly what we ordered and works well for it's intended purpose. I would caution you to be very careful nailing on the backboard, so as not to split the center shelf. My favorite feature of the Oskar Multimedia Wood Storage Cabinet is that they include plenty of extra shelves, unlike so many other brands. I have an entire stack of shelves that I can add as needed. I would love to have three or four more of these units.

I used this recorder alot, I have alot of classes,and the playback is good, it has little folders where if you recorded on one section rather than worrying that you haven't listened yet you can move to the next folder and record.  The sound quality is good, 36h record time which can be broken up to folders.  The only thing when you are recording make sure tht you adjust the volume, i forgot to turn the volume alittle higher and the recording was low,and that goes vice versa as well,. Nice little easy to maneuver recorder without having to be overwhelmed with the buttons

This is about the only mouse I buy, have gone through a couple of them in the past few years.  I just can't see spending alot of money on something thats going to naturally wear out.  This model is one that I find comfortable for the hand and durable in the using.  If you want a good, reliable, comfortable mouse, this logitech is a good choice

This is a great product for those who probably don't write too much. As an engineering student, I found the incapability of this product to interpret greek letters and equations quite understandable - however, it maxed out at 6 pages and that is just too little for even an hour or note taking in a tough class. Plus, It would be nice to be able to turn off the pen occasionally

This has been the best investment I've made for quite some time.  After experiencing the black out after the earthquake that hit Hawaii last year and having my computer die, I invested into this unit.  I read a few reviews from various sites that said there was issues with it and that often times it came broken.  I thought to myself the good reviews outweigh the bad so I'm going to try it and see.  Sure enough this unit came with no problems.  I plugged it in and let it charge over night.  I then added my computer and my monitor to it.  I've seen it kick in while the lights dimmed at my home and I'm so thankful that it has saved my computer.  If anything everyone should invest in one of these for their computers.  I fix computers for a living and more often than not people bring in their dead computers due to a power outage or power surge

BR1500 and BX1500 Backup UPS

This item is BR1500, which also called RS model vs. the BX1500 called XS models.  External battery BR24BP can be used for both BR1500 and BX1500.  The capability to connect external battery is great, since that can help reduce the downtime when California experiencing "rolling black" in the summer.

There are basically 2 differences between the Back-UPS RS(BR1500) and the Back-UPS XS (BX1500) models besides their names.


1. The Back-UPS RS models have both 1-line 2-wire phone/fax/modem data-line protection and 10/100base-T ethernet protection, where as the Back-UPS XS models only has 1-line 2-wire phone/fax/modem protection.

2. The Back-UPS RS models have both Boost* and Trim** as features of Automatic Voltage Regulation (AVR), where as the Back-UPS XS only has Boost. When the input voltage increases above the high transfer point of a Back-UPS XS model it will only go to battery.


*AVR Boost: The UPS is compensating for a low utility voltage. While the UPS can run in this mode indefinitely without any negative impact on the UPS, the circuit should be checked by a qualified electrician if the utility voltage is consistently low.

**AVR Trim: The UPS is compensating for a high utility voltage. While the UPS can run in this mode indefinitely without any negative impact on the UPS, the circuit should be checked by a qualified electrician if the utility voltage is consistently high. 

BX1500 does not have the AVR trim feature, when AC line voltage is higher than spec, it will switch over the battery power till the line voltage drops into the spec range.

Please note this is called "backup UPS", not the "smart UPS" line.  Backup UPS does not produce pure sine wave. When power lost, it will take some milli-seconds to switch over to battery power.  "Smart-UPS" produces sine wave and the output AC was from DC source all the time. When AC input lost, the AC output will not have any interrupt.

For most computers, the "backup-UPS" is good enough, since the power supply inside PC always have capacitors that can hold for about 100MS or longer. When "backup-UPS" switched over in about 20MS, the computer will continue operates without much impact.  But for A/V equipment, this may be an issue, especially the output is not pure sine wave.  I would not recommend use this UPS for A/V equipment

This is truly the best WIFI you can get on the market right now. Its lightning fast its 4 machines put into 1. Most importantly I've had the best gaming experience ever. Now i can host games on Xbox live without lagging the rest of my teammates and that is no fun. The Linksys WRT330N Wireless-N Gigabit Gaming Router is well worth its money and a great investment. I recommend it highly to anyone that needs a great WIFI for whatever reason

I have an Explorist 210 and this bracket fits it like a glove.  Good sturdy bracket, uni-directional, with strong suction cups - installed over a month ago and still has not come loose from windshield.  Great product for the money (in my case $30.76 + free shipping).  Purchased a second one for my other vehicle.

This product is really what I expected it to be. It has a very clear display with a high resolution for a 4 inch screen. The stereo sound is really good. And it has a long lasting battery. Buttons are easy to use. I tried recording from the television, and it is also satisfying. I had no problem about any divx or xvid video type. I really enjoy watching films with cowon a2.

I did a bunch of research before i bought the a2. The things that sold me on it were :
        1. Battery life.
        2. It's got a voice recorder &amp; encodes direct to MP3
        3. I love the fact that it's "folder view" , all my music on my PC is   organized by Artist then Album anyway, so it's just copy and paste to get it onto the a2.Which leads to.................
        4. Just copy mp3's &amp; avi's on there like a removable USB drive.
        5. A/V out to TV is cool.
        6. A/V in to record video is a nice extra.

So far it's played every avi i've thrown at it. 
I've got 15GB of music on there and just let it random play the whole lot I use the a2 mostly when driving. I got a nice FM transmitter that powers off the cig socket, sound quality is pretty good. Only problem i have is that i have to carry the a2 in the house at night for fear of it getting stolen out of the car !
I also invested in the silicon cover from zcover-it comes with a plastic screen protector and is perfect for when my 2 yr old wants to watch one of his movies on there (the a2 makes for a great pacifier !)
Mine came with the latest firmware on there so there was no need to upgrade.
I'm very happy with the a2 and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for am honest to goodness media player and has no need for subscription services or any other force fed crap.

Works great out of the box. Some reviews mentioned problems with the CD but mine worked fine but took some time to start on the first try.  It mounted easly under the upper kitchen cabinet.  No problem with signal strength happy to say since the unit it replaced had problems.  The brightness of the digital clock is adjustiable and I use it as a night light in the kitchen.  The remote control is powerful enough to control the unit from accross the room and adheres to the refrigerater (magnet) with my wife useing it to hang things.  This is a Thomson Inc product (purchased the GE &amp; RCA names several years ago) that makes TV's ect.
I am very happy with the product and recommend it

I purchased this dehumidifier to tackle my overly-humid house.  I live in California, but my house is naturally very humid (around 75% on average).  The humidity frequently gets up to around 80% and above in the winter as verified with a hygrometer.  Mold was fast becoming a problem.  I have used this dehumidifier for over two weeks now, and it is scary how well it works!  I placed it in the bedroom were the hummidity was at it's highest, and it lowered my 15'x15' room from 75% to 50% in less than three hours!
It has a quiet fan that I have no problem sleeping with.  The tank is easy to empty and it is light enough to move from room to room.
I have not owned any other dehumidifiers before, so I have no basis of comparison, but I am in love with this one!  It was completely worth the price

This has got to be the easiest piece of tech I have ever set up. Except for charging, it took under 5 minutes. It works as advertised. I use SkypeIn and SkypeOut. My phone bill is now $68 a year instead of $384. I also get voice mail for free with the SkypeIn. Call quality seems as good as Ma Bell. I was concerned with it being made by Netgear, as I have had spotty luck with their products. I liked this phone so much, I just purchase another handset(It can support up to 4). This phone will pay for itself in a few months

Im not a professional keyboard player. I bought this keyboard to have something to play around in with reason and Guitar Pro.  It suits those needs great.  Its detects right away and withing minutes you will be playing. 

The keyboard itself is extremly small reminds me of a kids toy keyboard.  If your looking for something more professional you will probably have to fork out the $100 bucks and get the bigger model.

This is a great laser pointer and the brighter wavelength of the green laser makes a huge difference. But to see the beam (not just the dot at the end of the beam) you need some sort of particles in the air for the light to bounce off of. Using the laser pointer with a little dust or mist in the air will make the beam clearly stand out. And if you are wondering, no matter how bright your laser is, without particles in the air you wont see the beam. At concerts where they use the big argon lasers, they always have fog machines near them to give give the laser something to bounce its light off of

Although I prefer the AKG K701 for most of my listening, this competing entry from Beyer is so close that it's almost a coin toss. (One recent comparison in a headphone artcle came up with a dead heat.) 

This is surprising, considering that the DT880 is one of the most reasonably priced of the major mid-priced headphones. The bass is full but nicely textured - not a touch of bass bloat to be found here. The highs are detaied and never seemed sharp to me, and the overall sound offers a huge soundstage. Instead of the music being on top of your, these Beyers lend a perceived distance of a few feet; ths makes classical music sound doubly elegant, and surprisingly makes rock music grandiose in an appealing kind of way. 

These headphones don't require a headphone amp, but certainly profit from one. The 30 ohm version makes for more volume, though the 250 ohm version is standard, and best for most daily listening. 

The DT880 sounds great, but lacks a tad of the K701's high-end sparkle. Conversely, Beyer's value, comfort, and workmanship can't help but impress. This is a phone that has labored under the shadow of the AKGs and the Senn 650s, but listeners are always impressed by the DT880s sound. It may be your best value in a mid-priced, all-purpose headphone

This has a nice size screen. It only has 3 buttons.Play pause and stop so if you like a dvd player without alot of pizazz this is it. I was trying to figure out how you picked the different scenes and you had to push the stop button. I just found this out by trial. There was a few times during the dvd that it would turn into digital. This would only last a second or two. At first I thought it was the dvd but its done it on all three of them. The volume control is on the side, as well as the power button. It could have a little higher volume but it was sufficient for me

I have some doubts that this product gets anywhere near the 400ft range it advertises, but it works nonetheless, and really considering that my router is in the basement and on the other side of the house, I figure I ought to be grateful that it works at all. I do suffer from fairly frequent disconnections, but I suspect it's related to where I have things in the house, no so much the product. In fact, I can usually view numerous wireless connections used by my various neighbors that this device picks up. Install went quickly and easily on my winxp pro sp2 machine. It's compact and conveinient to hook up to the desktop and laptops as needed. Can't complain, especially for the price

Being that the TV reception coming out of my VCR is always crappy, the first thing I did after getting my Monster Cable SV1/100-M A/V cable (to test is out) was plug one end it into my cable box's A/V output jack, then plug the other end into one of my VCR's A/V input jacks.  The result?  The TV reception coming through the VCR wasn't crappy anymore!!

I ended up getting two of these A/V cables to hook up my Sony DVD player to my TV via a Terk VS-4 switch.  The picture is phenomenal!!  I plan to get two more soon to improve the reception from my VCR &amp; my cable box.  These A/V cable are worth EVERY penny that you spend on them!!  You can't go wrong with Monster Cable!

This is a great card for a laptop, however they need to correct their problems with the installer for XP. Also to get thru to them for any help is a major challenge, took me 4 days to get thru on their 800 line. Once you do get to them they fix the problem right away, seems they know it will not install correctly. Then it works great

This is a great product for a busy professional or grad student who gives their Mac a lot of mileage.  I'm in law school, so I'm constantly throwing my computer in my bag along with heavy casebooks, keys, and other junk.  My old iBook survived tremendous abuse, and after two years looked like it had been through a war.  The Speck case protects the MacBook's shell and even the screen, in a roundabout way.  Normally, if you put a Mac into a briefcase or bag with heavy books, the books will press against the shell, and the screen inside will press against the keys leaving dents and screwing the the LCD.  The Speck case is very stiff, so even the heaviest books and the worst abuse don't push the screen onto the keyboard.  Plus, if you put a red case on a white Mac, people will think you're in some secret club that has access to red Macs.

Cons: it's next to impossible to remove the top case with two hands - you need a buddy to get it off.  Also, dust starts to collect under the bottom case (static?), so you need to take off the bottom monthly to clean.  Fortunately the bottom case is easier to remove for cleaning.

Totally agree with the other reviewers' comments. Originally, I was going to buy Canon's adapter for my Powershot A640 not realizing it was plastic!! Plus, even with shipping, this is still cheaper (by 5 bucks) and its metal! FYI--If you don't have any filters (like I didn't) get Tiffens 3 filter set 52mm (Circular Polarizer, UV protector, and 812-warming len) a good buy for the price--I bought it because of the reviewers' comments and don't regret it

I purchased 4 of these adapters (3 extra) so I could hook up my macbook's digital output for digital surround sound through my Logitech speakers. The product works exactly as I expected... great digital sound from my macbook. Parts Express did an excellent job of getting my order to me sooner than I expected (ordered on a Saturday, and they had the package to the courier by Saturday night.) Very prompt service... I would definitely order from them again. Overall a great product from a prompt company!

I've been looking for a pair of headphones like this for years.  I've used these for 8 months now and wear them almost everyday.  I ride a motorcycle everyday and I never leave without these.  First, the comfort is exceptional.  Even with my helmet on, I never get uncomfortable with these in my ears.  I've ridden 400 miles at a time without any problems.  Even when I need a break from the music, I leave these in because they do such a great job of blocking wind and bike noise.  I've used several other brands of canal earphones and none have been comfortable - tolerable at best, but most are painful with a helmet on.  The "bulb" you see in the picture rests in the crook of your ear, so there is nothing extending past your ear to get crammed in deep.  Second, the sound quality is fantastic.  Great bass, mids, and highs.  I've heard things in my music I never knew was there and I can't wait to listen more.  I can't recommend these enough.  I've bought a pair for my brother and may have to buy a pair for my wife because she keeps taking mine

Wow! I didn't trust the other review.  I needed a mini amp, so I decided to bought this one, because of the price and of the dual purpose.  Right out of the box, it actually smell bacon!! Amazing, it was true!  And not only that.  If someone is trying to kick you out of your house because of the noise of your beloved amp, and don't want to stop, this is the mini amp for you.  Can't believe the speaker in it.  And, about the disto, well, is OK for practice. Won't regret about it.

I've been using this NAS for a month and it's great!  The box is quite speedy with a Maxtor ATA 133 drive with a 16mb cache.  I have it wired and it never disconnects and will transfer large files without hanging.  Got it up and working in around 40 minutes and have it set to incrementally back up my files.  Very slick!  I can't get the built in FTP server to work through my firewall but I think that's a ports issue.  All in all a great box

When I bought these I was mainly looking for a long enough cord to be able to put my MP3 player in my pocket. Not only is the cord legnth great but so is the sound. I didn't expect the sound quality to be so good in such an inexpensive product. The cord also has a built in volume control so I don't have to dig the player out of my pocket to adjust the volume. The buds are quite comfortable, I have worn them for hours at a time with no problem. I love these

I just purchased a MoGo mouse, and I'm *amazed* at how usable it is.  I was extremely skeptical (and probably wouldn't have bought one) until I was able to try a colleague's mouse and see for myself how comfortable it is.  The ONE thing - and it's a pretty big thing - is the lack of "scroll-wheel" technology.  That's a sorely missed feature in this mouse.

That said, there are always trade-offs, but in this case that's the only one.  Battery life seems great, usability is great, convenience is great...just add the touch pad and it'll be THE mouse for notebook computer users!

When you look at the price, it may seem pricey but when you get the product, there is some serious engineering involved.  The web reviews have all been favorable and this is the reason I bought an Ergotron.  The attention to detail is incredible.  Mounting the middle monitor is definitely a two-person job. Other than that the installation was flawless.  This is a very solid and well machined.  Kudos to Ergotron.  (Also these guys are serious about ergonomics -- 10 pages on how to set proper height for various installations.) Wonderful product - 5 stars.  Shipping from Amazon was slow and behind schedule.

I am an IT Director and bought these for exercisers for my users. The outside is like a balloon, only much stronger rubber, and the inside is gel. When you squeeze them, the part that squeezes through your fingers changes color - it's cool! The resistance is very good and my users love them! Good product - great value and excellent quality

When you get these cartridges right out of the box they work great, but after you start to print out a lot of pictures you really notice the quality deteriorate. It really seems to run out of one color much quicker  than the others. Personally its usually red. It has caught me with my pants  down a couple times, going to print out a project the night before its due,  only to run out of red or blue ink. I would definetly suggest to always  have an extra one around just in case

This is a great case. I have had no problems with it, and works very well. It's also very "sexy" if you want to put it that way, and looks really cool. Only trouble I have is that when I open it sometimes, it'll make a click sound because 2 pieces touch, but its very minor and does no damage. It's a great item! However, if you intend to bang your laptop around a lot, I'd recommend one of those soft outer cases too, because this is not intended to protect the hard drive etc. Just protect it from scratches and smudges. I recommend it highly

After ruining another pair of over-the-head headphones, I decided to check these out.  They are actually on sale at 50% off, and I've just tried mine out.  The audio is very sharp, especially with the base, though it seems to be not as loud as my old pair, I can just increase the volume to compensate.  At $35, this is a GREAT deal.  They feel great.  The band that most headphones have presses down on your head, but not too much.  It also folds down quite nicely, though it looks too brittle to be able to handle too much stress.  Haven't tried out the actual noise-cancellation feature, but if the rest of the headphone quality is consistent, then it will work just as well.  It also comes with a carrying bag that can probably also hold your MP3 player, if you so wished.  However, it easily fits into a jacket pocket.  Great, great, great design and comfort

And all at a great price!

Bought this player for its size (sports) and its Napster compatibility. Updated the firmware after having a rocky start; but things seem a little more stable now. Also seemed to shut off in cold weather when outside for long periods (around 0 degrees Celsius) - odd behaviour - but mostly OK now that we are in the Spring teens again. Haven't found a case yet to protect from sweat. Interface is what I expected - dead simple. No complaints for the price

I was ready to take this player back to the store!  I checked the sandisk web site and stumbled across a link to "how to" videos.  This was the best thing I could have found.  The videos walk through all the settings you need to configure on your PC to get the player to work for drag and drop, showing album art...  I had no idea my PC was set not to show hidden folders!  Who would hide folders anyway?  Nonetheless I now have a player loaded with music and am a happy customer.  Like others have said the photo option is not that great so don't buy it for that.  I mostly want it for working out so pics don't make much of a difference to me.  DH has a 30G ipod so if I wanna see graphics I can just borrow that lol!

I have over 250 mp3 formatted songs on the player (and it's full) and will likely get a micro SD card so I can expand it a little bit.

All in all, I do like this little player

I have had other APC battery backup's in the past, and the only negative comment about the product is the size and space required for the unit.  Given our power failures, brown out, and the high wind and storms in our area the APC does an excellent job.  I have not only my desktop PC, but my scanner, printer and digital camera on the system and it has saved my equipment numerous time for the power surges and failures

     I did a lot of research, not wanting to rush into anything and then regret it after seeing something else a week later. I was about to buy the newest 40" 720p Samsung for $1899... then I stumbled upon this one at Circuit City for $1999 and bought it on the spot... paid about $50 for delivery and had it in my living room about three hours later. I've had it a week now, and I love it.
     Standard-definition picture quality is just okay, but are any of us buying these TVs to watch SDTV? I get about 15 HD channels through my cable company, including all four major networks plus ESPN, ESPN2 and a couple music and movie channels. Therefore, a majority of everything I watch is available in HD anyway. SDTV content still looks decent from the typical viewing distance of 10-12 feet. HD content looks awesome (including black levels), and my cable provider broadcasts in only 720p. I can only imagine how good 1080p content is going to look once it becomes available.
     I'm going to wait another year or two for the High-Definition DVD format war to play out before I buy a Blu-Ray or HD-DVD player. But I've watched standard-definition DVD on my Xbox with this TV, and the picture is beautiful. I'm sure High-Definition DVD would look a little better in a side-by-side comparison, but you will not have any complaints watching standard-definition DVD on this TV.
     In short, this is an excellent TV, especially compared to other 1080p  models in its size range. If you're looking for something in the range of $2000-$2200, this is the one you want. Enjoy

I have been using this mouse at work since it came out. After many miles of use, the scroll wheel has finally started to fail.  I can now spin the wheel several times before the screen actually scrolls.  The best feature of this mouse is the battery life.  A coworker who swears by his Logitech mouse would change his batteries every couple of months, but I usually got at least ten months out of mine.  I even took to dating the batteries when I installed them, just to rub it in.

This mouse is a bit heavy and does not slide as well as some, but overall I would recommend it.

Going to try a rechargable Logitech next time around

I don't know where the guy below got that this card doesn't work with Windows Media Center Edition because I just installed the latest XP drivers for the card on Media Center Edition 2005 and it works perfectly.  I sold my GIGAPort AG to get this because of the much better signal/noise ratio that the FireWire Audiophile has and it made a big difference.  Very clean sound!  I use it to DJ with using MixVibes, using the ASIO drivers and it works beautifully!  A great buy to say the least... pick one up, you wont regret it

First off... I like this unit.  It's EASY to use, and it does a fine job of taking your old LPs and making CDs out of them.  All you need to do is place a blank AUDIO CD into the deck (it doesn't work with regular data CDs), hit the phono/aux button, followed by the record button and then after you place the needle on the LP... take it out of pause.  It starts recording instantly.  Between each song, hit a button and it break the recording into tracks.  Pretty cool!

It's got great potential, but there are still a few shortcomings.  For example, I was surprised to see that it doesn't let you record off of the radio.  Just as surprising to me was the fact that the radio tuner wasn't digital. It's a pain in the neck having to fiddle with the dial to tune in to your favorite stations.  You turn back and forth over and over like it was a radio from 40 years ago.

I wouldn't mind the analog tuner too much if it at least had a handful of presets.  This also makes the remote control somewhat useless too.  Oddly, the remote does have an AM/FM button.  They should just label it the "Radio" button, because when you think of it, switching from AM to FM or vice versa using the remote makes no sense at all because you would need to re-tune the station too, using the dial.

Another key point is that the unit doesn't have any outputs at all.  So you can't pipe the output from the turntable into your other systems or use any other speakers.

I would rate this as 3.5 stars, but since we can't use half stars, I'll give it 4 for one big reason.... For all it's shortcomings, it works, and there are very few alternatives.

Speaking of alternatives, here are a few other options.

1. A standalone CD-Recorder.  I have one of these too.  The advantage of this type of deck is that it fits into your existing system like an old cassette deck.  In my case, my stand alone unit has two drives, so not only can I record from any source in my system, but I can dub from one drive to the other.  Also, my deck can make MP3 CDs from regular CDs (It's easier than using a PC, however the song titles are just numbers).  In my case, I opted not to use this for my LP projects, because I no longer have a turntable.  I decided that as long as I needed a new turntable, I might as well pay a bit more for this unit.

2. Crosley makes a simuilar unit, but it costs a bit more and the reviews I read seemed to point out that although it looks better, the turntable itself was flimsy and it skipped a lot.

3. A portable digital recorder like the iKey Plus.  I found one of these a few weeks ago and I love it.  You plug your turntable or other external source into it... plug a USB storage device into the port tap a button or two to decide the quality (.WAV vs several MP3 sampling rates)... Viola!  It records directly to your flash drive, iPod or external hard drive.  If you do go that route, make sure you get the "Plus" model.  The older model is outdated and doesn't work as well.

4. Use a PC.  Even though it will give you the best possible sound and options, it's out of the question for me because I do not want to move my PC near my stereo every time I want to make a recording, nor do I want to move my stereo next to my PC... or bog it down while I'm trying to use it for that matter.

Keep in mind that if you record your CDs using one of the stand alone decks, you can still clean up the hiss and pops by loading the CDs you made into a PC afterwards, then filtering the files with your favorite audio software, then re-burn the files to CD or MP3.

I bought this cute little speaker from Walmart (14$) and it is so compact and very useful. It also matches with my other speakers of Sony Dream system.

This has 4 USB ports (So good when they stay on your desktop rather than on your pC sitiing down the table.). They are lighted, so that you can plug them in even night. Speaker is good quality and it has one USB connection and One DC connection.

Quality of sound is good if not excellent. Overall It is a great buy for the price.

So I received my Go-510 and expected it to work right out of the box.  It powered up, great windshield adapter, no problems with the connections, bluetooth works perfectly, Ipod controls - no problem.  Just one thing, NO SATELLITE FIX !!  It would not lock on - even after one hour in the open sky.  I thought, here goes....bad tech support....ship it back...
But no.  I called tech support, got through to a human (very knowledgable) in only 20 seconds.  Problem was fixed by upgrading firmware and the unit works perfectly.  I read on many sites of the problems plaguing these units.  Apparently, they have all the bugs out because every aspect, every feature is cool and workable.  The TomTom Go-510 is highly recommended in my book and mad props to the tech support crew - way to roll

This is my first experience with HDTV and wide screen.  This 46" Sony TV is excellent with HD programs; with regular broadcasts, it is a bit muddy, but that is the fault of the signal, not the TV.  I am very pleased with the overall quality of the set.  I had the set professionally installed and set up, and I am sure glad I did: install and set up are not for amateurs like me; if anything ever happens, I will be hard pressed to reset things.  Sony's instruction manuals are not that great

My Panasonic RV31K is five years old this month and after thousands of hours playing movies it works just as well today as when I first took it out of the box. Panasonic makes quality products and just like anything else mechanical you can get a lemon. If this player ever dies (cross my fingers) I will get another Panasonic. I choose mine after reading all of the reviews here and in epinions.co

I had looked at numerous stands for my Yamaha keyboard and didn't want to spend a ton of money for a professional grade stand (at professional prices).  With that in mind, the Yamaha PKBX2 Double X Portable Keyboard Stand is a good choice at $29.99.  I had seen other stands that were not as sturdy (single X stands)and cost about the same price.

Tips for assembly: 
- Don't read the instructions, just look at the enlarged image of the keyboard on Amazon and assemble the stand the way it's shown.
- The bolts for attaching the arms and legs come screwed in to the stand.  Use the (included )Allen Wrench to remove them.

PROS:
- Low price.
- Solid, sturdy stand.
- Works for just about any keyboard.
- The stand's height is fully adjustable, and can be done in several seconds - without having to unscrew anything.

CONS:
- There is no way to attach a keyboard to this stand.  No screws, bolts or straps are included, even though most (including my Yamaha) keyboards have pre-drilled holes for screwing the board to a stand.  The keyboard simply sits on top of the stand.  I was VERY disappointed about this.
- The included Allen wrench did not work for one of the bolts.  The bolt came screwed in to the stand way too tightly to be removed using the included tool.  The Allen Wrench only stripped the bolt, it did not loosen it.  Luckily my husband had a better Allen Wrench of nearly identical size, and that one worked.  Without it, we would not have been able to loosen the bolt

I'm very happy with this device.  The suction cup holds very securly.  I would advise anyone who buys a satellite receiver to skip the adhesive mounting bracket that comes with it, it will come un-stuck eventually.  Just get one of these brackets and mount the radio right in the first place

I just purchased the Archos 604 about 3weeks ago. So far so good. It interfaces very easily with the computer. Though I have not tried it using Windows Media 10 yet. I recommend at least buying the Archos Docking Adapter Kit (if you do not plan on using the Archos to record programs). It allows you to charge the unit without the computer and also allows you to connect it directly to your digital camera to transfer photos.

The only negative that I have so far is that the volume, at its highlest level, is difficult to hear on an airplane. You may need some noise canceling headphones

The price I paid for this spindle of CD-R's was pretty good and have not had a problem yet. The only price that I have seen that beats this one was Staples running a sale of 50 for $10, but I have yet to use the stock that I bought as I still have about 25 left on the spindle. If you don't want to wait for their sale, this is an excellent bargain. The print surface has done very well with the inks from my Epson Photo R-220

I enjoyed putting this together. The spacers kinda threw me until I realized you use 2 per pole under each corner of a shelf. I got it assembled then my daughter pointed out that the DVD shelves weren't spaced properly [CD sized] so I had to take it apart and redo it, but that wasn't too bad. The spacers snap apart easily enough, even for my feeble fingers.  It's not terribly sturdy [maybe I didn't get the poles screwed down tightly enough] but as long as it's in its permanent location, holds the multimedia well. I really like the way it looks. Bought this item for my teenager and will have to get myself one, too :

The AMD Ahtlon 64 Venice processor is great. Installed into my new Gigabyte MB without a hitch and runs very cool. That will give up some room for future overclocking. Overall I would highly recommend the processor. By applying for their credit card, I received a really low price from Amazon which was very surprising. About $170.00 with free shipping and no tax. Everyone else was $200-$230 for the same processor. It is a great CPU at a good price from Amazon

I looked at all the different cases for my new iPod with video, and the reviews kept pointing me back to this case.  So I bought it.  it exceeds my expectations.  It's fantastic.

My ipod is now completely contained and scratchproof.  This helps when down the road I might want to sell it.

The screen cover is perfectly clear and seems very durable.  I like the fact that it's held off of the ipod's screen so it won't scratch.  

The clickwheel is easily usable, actually more so because of the circle around it.

I bought the case on Amazon from SonicSwap and am astounded at how fast I got it.  2 days! Amazing.

This case is for the 60GB iPod with Video.  It clearly says that in the title; not sure how that one reviewer got confused about that.

Don't hesitate.  This is THE case

I gave my son a Garmin 60C for Christmas last year. Tinkered with it for a couple of days before handing it over. It worked well. Of course I wanted one for myself, but cash is cash, so I've been putting it off. (Side note - I wanted to borrow it for a trip this past spring, and when they went to get it, it had been stolen from their car map-pocket. It seems these are high-theft items; keep'em on a short leash.) My wife hadn't gotten me any "big" Christmas gift, so I told her I knew what I wanted, and started shopping. I debated between the eXplorist 500 and 600. Chose the 600, with its altimeter and thermometer. Probably could have lived without them, but hey, it's Christmas!

It came yesterday, so I charged it a bit, and then it had no trouble finding 4 satellites under my deciduous tree cover. I had to go out to the street for the Garmin to find satellites. Took it out for a spin today. Spot-on navigation as I ran errands. It tracked back almost to the exact spot I had marked for home, though it had me driving down the wrong side of the street on that portion of my route that was a duplicate - so it's off by a few feet. (Maybe it still thinks it's in Britain?)

Now - why only 4 stars? 1) the USB connector can attach to the unit either way. There's no instructions anywhere to say which way it should go. I called the 800 # and spoke with someone (in New Delhi) who had heard this a lot. She told me what to do, and the PC immediately recognized the GPS file system - as a removable disk drive, as advertised. I really find their Website information near-zero. Something as elementary as this should be covered on a Website after the 3rd call, eh?

2) I bought the Mapsend 3D Topo software. I am interested in elevations. And it has detailed street maps. BUT - they're not routable! If you want routable streets (where the unit will route you along streets and not just a crow's flight direct path) for following in a car, then either you have to get both map products, or choose. It's rather frustrating. And the sales information provided on Amazon and the Magellan sites does not make this critical lack very clear. It tells you what you can do, but not what you can't and there's no product comparison to see what the differences are. On the Mapsend Topo box, it says very clearly, "NAVTEQ roads and streets data - like that found in the most expensive car navigation systems (non-routable)". Er, excuse me, then it's not quite like that found in expensive car systems, is it? I concur with other reviewers who find the software selection verbiage (on Amazon and Magellan) more obfuscating than informative. Why can't someone create a simple comparison chart for all the various map packages

This 23" LCD HDTV has excellent image quality and looks really stylish, too.  It also comes with HDMI so you can hook up the latest HD video source such as HD-DVD or Blue-ray hi-def DVD players.  The LCD panel itself displays vivid, evenly-lit images, and ghosting appears to not be a problem on this model.

I personally ended up opting for the Sharp LD-23SH1U HDTV LCD monitor because the Sharp works as PC/Mac monitor (plus J&amp;R started offering a $[...]rebate).  But I think this Panasonic is a great choice, too, no doubt about that

I've had this phone less than a week, but I have been pleased with it's performance so far. The set up was somewhat tricky, as many, if not all Skype addresses use a period in the address. None of the literature showed how to find the period. By accident I noticed it was available on the 1 button. After discovering that, the installation went flawlessly. If one is already familiar with the use of the alpha/numeric keypad, one would have no problems. If one is learning on this phone with the literature provided, one needs help. The phone has worked well with both the landline, and the Skypeout alternatives. I'm pleased enough that I'm buying two more as the equipment will accomodate up to four phones.

Turns out I don't like in-ear ear phones.  The sound on these is good, though the bass is a bit much in my opinion.  The in-ear style makes me feel deaf to the outside world.  If you do like this style, these are pretty good.

To my eyes, the printer's rendition of colors is above average. It isn't horrible but neither is it the best. Pricewise it's an excellent deal with the 64mg of memory and the duplex feature. 

We've been using this hp quite a lot to generate mailing labels via Tray 2 (the default paper supply) and haven't any problems. The manual (electronic file) advises "Never print on the same sheet of labels more than once or print on a partial sheet of labels." So it's a pity that the rest of a multiple mailing label sheet has to be tossed for just one label. 

A wonderful quality of experience is the near "instant on" (very minimal warmup) feature and it's quiet. My previous Okidata c5300 was a noisemaker and was turned on only just before printing. Its time delay was also a disadvantage. I think most people will be very happy with the HP.

I got the Canon CP400 printer a while back so I could make the occasional print to hand out (or put silly captions on "bad" Christmas party photos).

I don't know how the printer manages to keep the image aligned as the paper goes in and out 4 times (yellow, magenta, blue, and the clear coat) but when it drops it out, I have a pretty nice print, complete with address lines and a stamp outline on back (plus Canon logo of course) - suitable for mailing as a postcard. About 1/2" of each end gets removed  after printing as it is used for traction of the rubber roller in the printer.

I frequently print 3 shots vertically on a 4 x 6 card as sort of a mini proof sheet. I've also used the 4 x 8 size to print 2 side by side.

Fun stuff

This is a great printer for those who want to print on 12x12 scrapbook pages. It works well with heavier(cardstock) paper. It also prints great photos. I have a MAC i-book. I also use The Print Shop 2 program with it. It gives me great versatility with my pages &amp; photos

My criteria for my new printer purchase was:
1. 11x17
2. individual inks
3. reliable printer company
4. easy installation/good customer service
5. price (this was a bit pricey but the next step up was not a choice)

So far for my needs this has been a great printer so far.  It does great quality prints for photos, school projects and more.  I wanted to have more versatility to make posters, labels, photos, etc...  My last HP wide format printer (1200c) lasted for over 5 years and I took it everywhere.  I have only had this for a few motnhs but it hasn't been a disappointment yet

Why Blu-Ray Kills HD DVD

The only thing I will say about the BDP-S1 is that it is top quality.
Picture and sound quality are top-notch, but everything really depends on the software.

Now, if you are undecided about which camp to follow (Blu-ray or HD DVD), I'm here to tell you that Blu-ray will win.

You see, I have both Blu-ray and HD DVD.
I have about 20 HD DVD movies and about 20 Blu-ray movies. 

In terms of picture and sound quality, they are the same, but it is completely dependant on the software.

But here is where the similarities end.

1) Blu-ray is more durable. 
The BD movie discs have scratch-resistant coating. They don't scratch unless you forcefully scratch them.
On the other hand, the HDDVD movies scratch like heck. I put all of my movies in a CD case. I recently noticed that ALL the HDDVD movies are scratched, but NONE of the Blu-ray movies are scratched. These are stored in the SAME CD case by me. I am extremely careful. None of my movies even have a fingerprint on them. So when I see scratches on 100% of my HDDVD movies, that really upsets me!!!!!

2) Blu-ray costs less to BUY.
What? Superman Returns BD is $24, Superman HDDVD is $28. The Departed BD is $24, The Departed HDDVD is $28.
Now the HDDVD DUAL format has both a standard DVD and HDDVD movie, but who in their right mind would want to buy an HDDVD to watch a 480p picture? 

Right now you can get a $500 PS3 or $400 Toshiba HDDVD player. 
Later this year, Sony will come out with a $300 Blu-Ray disc player. HDDVD will most likely drop their prices. So the hardware will cost the same in both formats.

3) Blu-ray has more capacity.
For less money, you can get a 50GB Blu-ray movie versus a 30GB HDDVD movie.

And what if in 5 years they develope SUPER High-Definition 1920p picture and SUPER Hi-Def 8.1 DTS-HD Sound? What if this requires 75GB or 100GB?
HDDVD can go up to 51GB.

Peace.

Everything about the Sonos worked as advertised.  It was a snap to set up and it is slicker than I anticipated.  The interface is commonsense and well thought out.  It is the only decent solution for tying together multiple discrete sound systems within a house to play the same music simultaneously.  You can also play different music, all obtained from the same computer source or internet radio.   It is one of those rare products that instead of disappointing actually packs many pleasant surprises

I agree with the comments posted here.  Like most of us, I was interested in the Bose sound yet put off by the prestige price.  Even on E-Bay the going price ended up being around $400 -- for a used older model.  So I did some research and stumbled upon a nice comparison-shopper article that put the Bose up against several competitors, including this high-end TEAC.  I have to say that I'm entirely satisfied.

The chrome retro look is quite appealing, and the model has a couple of features that, for me, beat out Bose entirely.  I wanted a top-loading door like the old Bose models but also the ability to play MP3 like the new ones, and this gave me both.  The sound and punch is remarkable.  At flat setting, it is a bit bassy, that's true, but you get a -5 to+ 5 range for both bass and treble adjustment: I set mine at -3 and +1 respectively and am very happy with the sound in my bedroom.  Input and alarm functions are limited but not problematic.  10 presets can be cycled though quickly enough, and just remember to set it to a station (or load a CD) that you'd want to be woken up to before calling it a night!

TEAC customer service I can't comment on, but I bought a reconditioned unit from an Amazon seller for less than $100, including shipping.  A sweet deal for a sweet machine.

I didn't want to fork over 500 for a BOSE or Boston Acoustics, or even 350 for a Cambridge Soundworks, and then I found this little gem, for about 175 + shipping.  I've had it for a few days, and so far I am impressed.

The SX  functions are very intuitive, easy to set the time and both alarms.  I thought it was extremely innovative to have the button that sets the time located inside the CD player compartment, no more accidentally changing the time instead of the alarm!  The alarm buttons themselves will illuminate when they are activated, which is great.  The buttons themselves have a nice click when you press them, and the CD, AM/FM tuner, and AUX buttons will glow when they are active.  The volume control and tuner knobs are recessed, but this keeps the player from having any unsightly bulges I suppose.  The snooze/sleep button is a good size.  The sleep function can be toggled for 90, 60, or 30 minutes.

The range of the speakers is great when you consider the size of the SX.  The speakers measure about 2.5 inches, and with the volume turned up, you can definitely feel the air being pushed out of the bottom of the unit.  I like that it has adjustable bass and treble, which can vary from -5 to +5.  I have the bass set to +3 and treble to +2 and it sounds great.  It doesn't have the range of say a home entertainment system, but definitely rivals my Sony bookshelf system.

The MP3 player on the SX could be better, but is adequate.  During playback, the LCD will scroll to display the filename, title, artist, and track.  It can be programmed for up to 64 tracks, but I haven't had the time or patience for this.  Instead, I just numbered the MP3 tracks in the order I wanted before burning them to the CD-rom.  The repeat function works well, and you can choose either to repeat one track, repeat all tracks, or repeat just one folder.  However, the shuffle function is rather limited, as it has only one setting which is to randomly play an MP3 from any of the folders (resulting in less than desired combinations of music), and it stop playing music after each song from all the folders has been played once.

One of the things I looked for in a clock radio is an auxilliary input mini-jack, and it also has a jack for headphones.  I have my laptop on my nightstand right now, and it playing MP3s on winamp sound great plugged into the SX.

There are only 2 levels of brightness for the backlit LCD.  The default level cannot be changed or dimmed, and is rather bright in a dark room.. it will make everything glow.  Takes a little while to get used to, but is not say brighter than a typical nightlight I guess.  It is a bit hard to read at night because the numbers are so small, and the brightness of the LCD can kind of drown out the analog display, but then again I wear glasses so I suppose I have nothing to blame besides my bad eyes.  When the radio or CD player is in operation, the dial becomes significantly brighter but it can be toggled to the lower/default level with the dimmer button on the remote control.

One other thing about the unit was the lack of a battery backup, and you will notice this is the case with many Japanese units, including the Sony clock radios.  I guess the power grid in Japan is really stable, so they don't have use for this, but still, it would be nice if there was an option for a backup 9 volt battery.  On the other hand, I was informed by TEAC tech support that the unit does contain a capcitor which will retain the time and alarm for "up to 3 hours".  I haven't had the time to test the maximum threshold, but I can say that I did unplug the clock for about a minute, and when I plugged it back in, sure enough the time and alarms were still correct.

Overall I am really impressed by this unit.  The only thing that could be better is if the MP3 player shuffle had a few more options, but I guess this is ok as many I have seen MP3 clock radios without any shuffle function at all!  Also, I wish the LCD backlight could be adjusted a little more.  It is a bit pricey at just under 200, but I have heard many clock radios, and you would have to spend 350+++ to get anywhere near the sound quality of the TEAC SX

I got this for my wife to use in the kitchen and she loves it.  The unit is beautifully designed, fun to use and has amazing sound for something so small.  My only gripe is that the tuner is not very strong.  I live in a tough area for reception, and there's slight static on my favorite stations.  The FM antenna attachment that comes with the unit helps quite a bit, but the reception is still not totally clear.

That being said, I'm glad I got it, and when my wife's happy, I'm happy

I use my LX4 2.1 system as my desktop PC speakers. I got this recommendation from Maximum PC, since the LX4 5.1 system was 2005's best speaker system. You can view their gear of the year review here: http://www.maximumpc.com/2005/12/m-audio_studiop_1.html. Being skeptical of a $550 5.1 system with only 27 watts to each satellite, I wanted to start slow and only ordered the 2.1 system. As soon as I purchased cables (FYI: no 1/8" stereo to two 1/4" mono cables seem to exists -as far as I've seen--, so you have to use adaptors) I was blown away by the crisp flowing sounds of the speakers. I wasn't used to speakers with crossovers, where only the each type of speaker (tweeter, woofer, and sub) gets the right frequencies, so no overlapping exists. All the sounds are crystal clear and the housings is very dense and resilient, while the speakers themselves are of superb build quality. After only a few hours of listening to many kinds of music and playing sound-intensive games, I immediately hopped back online and ordered myself the 5.1 expander setup.
If you are looking for speakers that play really loud, or can fill a living room with the desired feel for an action movie, these are not for you. But if you want incredibly accurate PC speakers or relatively cheap studio monitors this is definitely the setup for you. You will not be disappointed if you buy the LX4 for your bedroom or for computer use

Amazing sound comes from these tiny inexpensive headphones. The different size buds are very comfortable and help produce the deep bass sound once you find the pair the fit your ear. 

when I first got them I put the smallest buds on first and thought I had just bought the worst headphones. So I tried the largest buds and found they fit very comfortably and because of the seal they created in my ears they acted as an air tight bass box improving the sound ten fold.

And just let you know I ussualy cant wear earbud headphones because they hurt my ear holes or they just don't fit righ

I reserved the 5th star rating for this unit as I haven't authored or copied very many DVDs with it yet.  However, what I have accomplished with it is commendable.  I can copy an entire commercial DVD (Movie + all the extras) under 50 minutes.  I have composed a Slide show DVD with my own MP3 background music selections and am quite pleased with it.

So far, no coasters.  I am now in the process of producing DVDs of my old 8mm home movies.  The converter is giving me more problems than anything.  Still recommend the PX-755UF for anyone interested in an external burner.  Installation was a snap (plug-n-play)

These fit over everything very well, and they stayed put without stretching out, which is why my original pads fell off.  I guess it's one of those products that you can't do much better than $10 for, but maybe they could give you double the number of pads or something..

I would give a high recommendation for this TV.  It is the perfect size for a bedroom especially if you're not looking to overwhelm the room but you just want something to watch a late night movie, the morning or evening news, or the late shows in high def.  DVD player works great and really completes the package as it seems not to increase the size of the TV at all.  The picture is outstanding and isn't that what really matters in the end??!!  The only little annoying thing concerns what would have been a great feature but has a big limitation - the TV has an auto-on feature so that you can use it like an alarm clock but it requires that you select a channel on which to tune the TV once it goes on.  It you are use the HDMI as I am to get signal from your cable box, you must have the TV input mode set to HDMI but you can't set the auto-on to the HDMI input (it must be a channel number).  The engineers just didn't think that one through all the way.  Oh well, still a great TV

Got this drive a few weeks ago for an Apple Power Mac G4 Cube.
The G4 Cube has no fan so drive noise can be very obvious.
  
Thought the original drive was quiet until this drive was installed.  
This drive puts the original drive to shame with how quiet it is.  Unbelievable.  

Don't even hear the drive spinning up when the machine comes out of sleep.
Disc access is barely audible from a distance of 6-8 inches from the Cube and is totally non-existent more than 12 inches from the Cube.

Will not hesitate to buy Seagate Barracuda drives for all future machines.
The 5-year warranty is a winner.

Highly recommend this drive for its silence, speed, cost and warranty

I have a Denon 2307CI pumping these speakers and let me tell you, I can't even crank up the system to the highest as these speakers ROCK my entire house FROM THE BASEMENT!!!

The chip works just as advertised.  I have had no problems with it, it was easily formatted to my Kodak camera, and it stores a huge amount of pictures and video, either about 280 pictures or almost an hour of video.  Great product, I would recommend it for anyone looking for a lot of storage space for a good price

Fast Large Format Printer, but Flimsy Plastic Construction

We now have three of the K850 printers in use, one with a built in print server, second paper tray, and duplexer.  So far, the printers have proved to be reliable, fast, and comparatively inexpensive to operate.  Power on, pre-print, and post-print noise may be objectionable to users who are located close to the printer.

Capable of using the same HP 10 black and HP 11 individual color ink cartridges, as well as replacement print heads as the HP Business Ink Jet 1100d and HP Business Ink Jet 1200d, the K850 shares the same low, per page operating cost as the 1100d and 1200d printers.  Full page color photographs print in roughly 32 seconds, with a roughly eight second delay prior to the start of printing; similar prints from other printers may require from one to five minutes to print the same full page color photograph.  White horizontal lines were present in the full page color photograph, possibly indicating that one or two of the nozzles in the print heads, shipped with the new printer, are defective.

The printer handles paper sizes up to 13" x 19", so it easily handles B size (tabloid, 11" x 17") paper commonly used for small engineering prints and foldable newsletters.  The printer software installs without problem, although a reboot will likely be required.  For network capable K850 printers, the software install automatically finds K850 printers on the network, and adds a "HP Standard TCP/IP Port" to the computer configuration for communication with the printer.  For non-network capable K850 printers, both USB and parallel port connections are supported.

Positives:
* Uses ink that is compatible with other printer models, helping to keep operating costs down.
* Fast printing for full page color, and even faster black printing with spot color.
* Large format color printing, which is helpful for quick generation of engineering prints.
* Nearly idiot proof print cartridge replacement - light turns on to indicate the color that needs to be replaced, printing stops automatically, user replaces ink cartridge, and printing continues.
* Separate ink cartridges and print heads means less aligning of print cartridges/heads after ink cartridge replacement, larger capacity ink cartridges, and lower operating cost.

Negatives:
* Minimal install of HP software from the CD requires at least 100MB.
* Low capacity HP 13 print cartridges ship with the printer.
* Power-on, pre-print, and post-print noise, just like the Business Ink Jet 1100d and 1200d.  However, there is very little noise produced while printing.
* Cheap plastic cover over the print cartridges, similar to that used on the 1200d.
* Large footprint

I bought this mount for a philips 42" plasma TV.  The TV weighs probably about 100LBs.

  I thought the price for it was OK, but i don't know how much an average mount would cost and think the price i paid was pretty good compared to some other mounts.  

  The mount was put on our living room wall by a "handy man" because i didn't have a stud finder.  He was able to to put the mount on the wall very easily and the assembly was pretty basic.  The mount sits very well secured and the frame of the mount is very durable and strong which leaves me with a good sense that my investment is properly secured.

  The 5o tilt function is very nice to have and is being used so the TV sits a little high, but is aimed perfectly and adds a nice presentation to the house.  The room for the input cables is a little small, and causes some cables to be bend a little close to the connector than i would like to see but haven't noticed any degradation in the signal.  None of the cables so far look damaged and will remain that way, so its not of a concern.  I took the cables and made a 1" "trunk" of cables with the power cable and all and video inputs and it seamlessly hangs down the middle to a cabinet with all the accessories.

  The TV sits very close to the wall which was a key characteristic of the project even with the 5o tilt.

  I rate this item with 5 stars because it is very well made and very strong.  It also looks nice and stays well hidden.  Its features with the 5o tilt work great and the locking bar makes removing the TV easy(I had to take it off the wall to trunk the cables).  I am very very happy with it and would definitely recommend this product

I bought this product to hang a 42" LCD.
I am pleased with this mount but there are some concerns.  The mount is only 32" wide.  The "virtual axis" tilt is basically a clip that can be added on to obtain a 5 degree tilt which working perfect for me.  There are only two tilt options with this mount, vertical (hugs wall nicely) and the 5 degree.  Being 32" wide you will not hit 3 studs if they are 16" centers.  Make sure you get at least 2 studs.  My experience is this mount does not support VESA 400x800mm pattern.  800mm is ~31.5 inches and the brackets can not be spaced more than ~30 apart.  My TV did have another attaching pattern but I had to use the M5 bolts (provided with mount).  I would feel safer if this mount did support the 800 spacing where I could use the thicker M8 bolts.  A 42" LCD isn't going to weigh as much as a 50"+ TV, so take that into consideration.  I am still pleased with this product as it is very sturdy.

This is absolutely the best mp3 i have ever owned. What makes it the best?
1. 16 million color 2.5 LCD touchscreen. 
2. Battery life is too good to be true. 52 hours audio 10hr video.
3. The best sound, it has how much tweaks, its sick. You can slowdown a song or make it sound like the chipmunks. Has BBE,Wide stereo, enhancement stereo etc.
4. The volume is sooo dam loud. I had a Zune and the volume level was at 20, the lourdest it could go. The D2 level is 50 and at 30 it sounds as high as the zune.
5. You can encode AVI video bitrate at 1.5mbps.Also have WMV which you can encode at 768kbps.
6. No need to install to transfer files, it works like a USB flash drive.
7. You can change backgrounds and if you put a black background and your text is black, you can change the text color to 20 difference colors or make you own.
8. The touchscreen is smooth and flawless. WHen playing music it tells you the info of the file. example bitrate info, Hz etc. Something that is lacking on the big boys. 
9. Has tv output, also has a recorder to record conversations.
10. Can view .txt files.
11. Can view pics at very high pixels.
12. Fm tuner, you can record from the FM radio. You can set the bitrate from low to 256kbps.
13. Has a SD slot for more storage. Get a 8 gig SD for a total for 12 gig. Imagine in 2 years when they have 20 gig SD.
14. Great support, firmware updates are always available.


Plus sooo much more

This particular Cam has some issues but as long as you understand how to configure it, it will blow you away.  I've heard people complain about Dlink and they do have to get on the ball with tech support, autually their tech support sucks but I don't need them.  This is not a plug and play device so study the online manual carefully.  When you actually learn how to use it, you won't buy anything else for the price.  If you are tech savey, you will really enjoy the product.  I have nine cams installed at three locations.  Using their IP software you can view upto 16 at once.  The reason I'm back, on this site, is because I need to order two more.  I did have to return my first one but it was a pre-production unit and somebody forgot a timing gear.  Dlink sent my replacement direct.  The oldest cam has worked flawlessly for a year now.  One last comment, the next closent cam is a panasonic but for equal quality you will pay 50% more with less features

I like this printer.  There a few minor quarks, but it's fast and the prints come out good.  The one thing to watch for is making sure the ink tape cartridge stays tight.  If it's lose it will start making bad prints.  It takes less than minute to pull the cartridge out, tighten it and start printing again.

I am also using this with the Mac OSX OS.  Though the device says it will only work with PC and mentions something about the CASIO CW Utility for use on a Mac, but no where on the Casio site could I find the mentioned Utility.    After some searching I cam e accross this:

[...]

This allows the CW-100 to work fine on a Mac.  Though I have never seen the  PC software that comes with printer, I have read that this mac version does not have all of the text formating options. This is enough to get around, since you can make a JPG version of your label, put that in the print area and print away.  The JPG can be what ever image/text you want.  Resolution is great too.  I print at 300dpi.

All in all, I found this to be a great purchase.  I make music and do not have the money to send out to have my CDs done.  This print has more than paid for itself by allowing me to make professional looking cds and very little cost.  Great the DIYer

If you're an anti-commercial radio type this tuner will probably not win you over.  If however you don't like paying a monthly charge for satellite radio and you want something more than just standard AM/FM you might like this tuner. Many stations in the top 50 cities have stations transmitting HD signals.  The quality of HD is most amazing on quiet passages in Classical music, there is no noise at all, very quiet. You do notice!  The HDT-1 is quite sensitive. It will pull in stations that other tuners won't, and I'm not even talking about the HD2 streams that the stations are starting to feature. 

Clear Channel for all the bashing people do of them is doing a great job with HD.  Their stations sound good and most of the FM's are doing HD2, a few have some interesting formats not heard on most AM/FM stations.  I hope the get even more adventurous. 

My only disappointment is you need a strong signal to get HD to lock in on AM or FM.  I don't believe that to be a fault of the tuner, it's the HD system and just like FM did I'm sure it will improve (ask someone over 50 about FM drift) .  I give it 5 stars, it's not perfect but for the price it's very good and for a first generation product I don't think it could be better than this

This is a great little power strip that allows me to maximize the contents of my briefcase. One of the most useful things I have ever bought for business travelling. Very well made. I would give it 5 stars if it was a little less expensive

I have been enjoying these speakers outside by my pool for several months now, and the quality of the sound is excellent, particularly given the reasonable price.  I'm sure you can get better performance, but it will cost much more.  These speakers are a rare find in today's business world -- something that is actually a good deal...

I must admit, the first review posted here on the D320 made
me a little nervous.  My experience is quite different, and
after several months of ownership I am quite pleased.

I'll give a point by point rebuttle to the initial review, as
that's the only point of reference (so far):

1) Yes, pick up a USB cable,

2) Printer driver installation on Win98 essentially required no
   user intervention.  With WinXP however, I do seem to recall
   having to muck with it more, but I'm hazy on the details now,

3) I have printed scores of multi-page documents, many over 15
   pages without any problems whatsoever.  I've had no spills
   or jams of any kind,

4) I have not seen any "paper-curl" problems whatsoever,  

5) I leave the paper cassette lid/manual-feed slot in place at
   all times as I have no problem with it.  For doing many
   two-sided copies, it is indeed easier to place the copies
   back into the paper cassette.  But that's my experience with
   any copier I've used.

6) Making two-sided copies is easy and as efficient as I
   expected.  I've simply experienced no problems.

7) I've experienced no copier caused misalignments.  If my 
   copies have been crooked, it was because I set them on the
   glass improperly.

I am very happy with this unit.  It copies as I expect it to, 
and prints just the same: quickly and without event.  It's been
able to properly print from all Windoze applications I've thrown
at it, and ones many users may not even be using, such as
Ghostscript, Acrobat, SecureCRT, PAF, and all image viewing
software I've tried.  And I've got several machines networked
together (Win98 and WinXP) that can all print to the D320 fine
using printer sharing.

BTW, the D320 comes with a full, 3500 page toner cartridge too,
not a starter unit as with some printers/copiers

I struggled between this and the shure e2c. I decided on the e2c, after comparing also with the etymotics r6i and the ultimate ears superfi3. This one has the least clarity, but wonderful bass. If I don't listen to as much classical music, I'd definitely pick vmoda vibe. It makes even terrible pop songs sound cool.

I had to reject it because wearing it was not comfortable for my left ear at all for some reason, and I had an extremely hard time putting it in, even with the help of my bf. The vmoda did not come with any foam, only the silicon ear pieces. I settled on the less bass but more clarity and more comfortable e2c

This is by far the best radio I've ever had for singing in the shower.  No more fumbling and messing with the dial while I've got soap in my eyes... 10 fm presets, 5 am presets and 5 tv presets + weather, I'm always able to find something good to listen to.  It works great for when I'm out in the yard doing some work as well.

The maps are good enough for navigation of streets and outdoor adventures.  It allows downloading tracks and waypoints from the GPS, editing them and saving to files or the GPS.  It is annoying to have to put the last CD in your drive to use the program

I was programming an Ipod for a friend and became interested in buying one for myself.  I went to the store to get some info on the Ipod, and luckily the departments store I frequent didn't carry the unit, but offered the Zune.  I came straight home, did my reasearch, and ordered on the same day.  The Zune is far more superior than any Ipod model that I have either read about or experienced for myself.  And a much better deal moneywise.  I must say that you shouldn't get a Zune unless you are running a Windows version with SP2 or higher, for any other ver. won't recognize the unit.  I had a pc w/SP1 and Media Center 2002, so I thought I was in trouble.  Against my initial thoughts on SP2, I went ahead and upgraded, and haven't had any problems yet.  The sound is great, videos are decent, and the software is very user friendly.  I would check out the other models of media players, especially the Archos brand, for they have a bigger screen and hard drive.  But for audio and a few videos, this unit is worth the money

This is my second set of Garmin radios.  I have had the 120's for a couple years now and had to try out the new 530's.

First of all I really like the new color screen and the added features.  The altimeter has been upgraded over the 120's and seems to be more accurate.  My old 120's sitting right next to each other would display different altitudes.  I would not use the data to survey a site but it is more accurate than the older models.  We do a quite a bit of skiing an the altitude displays are helpful when your on the lifts or trying to figure out how many vertical feet you have skied. Especially if your using different lifts and not going all the way to the top.

The new compass is also helpful.  With the older models you would have to be moving for the compass to work right.  After calibrating the new compass (turning in a circle) it will work just like a regular compass.  I still carry a regular one in my pack while hiking as a backup, but the compass on the 530 works great and has not let me down.  You can also route off the compass by lining up the sites on the 530 with where you want to go. The 530 will then guide you there and keep you on track if bush whacking and can't see your next way point.

As with all the Rino radios the microphone is a little on the weak side.  I really think it's because of the waterproofing that they do.  If you don't put it close to your mouth when speaking it's really not that bad.  I did pick up a pair of throat mics and they have solved any problems at all with clear communications.

Lock up problem.  I have experienced this once or twice the first time I used them.  I did the Garmin update and have not had the problem since.

Overall these new 530's are GREAT.  I have been using them for close to 2 months every weekend and sometimes during the week.  Now that I have 4 of these (2 120's and 2 530's) these things are a blast to have when we are with a group.  Looking forward to the ski slopes this winter.  We always seem to get separated at some point and never find each other for hours.

If you do a lot of outdoor activities or any Geocaching with more than one person these are perfect!!

I had researched for a long time before I finally made my purchase. The final reasons for this purchase was the Consumer Reports Best Buy recommendation for the larger 42" version of this Olevia set. I had debated about purchasing a TV with 1080 but decided against doing so when I read that in a set this size that the naked eye could not tell the difference between 1080 and 720. I needed the 37" set due to the entertainment center we already owned, which cost 2.5 times the price of the TV, so it wasn't leaving the house. The TV opening would have allowed a 40" but I am glad I stayed with the 37" because the set-up would have been difficult if not impossible with a 40" because of the need to turn the set at angles. I compared the two TVs at the Olevia site and the only difference was the speakers. I also saw the Olevia at a friend's house and was impressed with the quality. The best price was found through Amazon.com. I placed my order on a Friday evening and the set was delivered by UPS in perfect condition on Wednesday. The set-up of the TV was simple. The only problem I experienced was with the remote. Here's the good news: I sent an email to tech support and quickly I had an answer that was simple to follow and the remote worked perfectly the same evening that I set-up the TV. Even though I use the surround sound through our stereo, I actually was satisfied with the sound through the TV speakers. A small problem is that the Time Warner Cable Box remote control does not operate the TV, so we do have to use multiple remotes, but that's only a minor inconvenience. Our family has been very pleased with the TV. I would highly recommend this TV to anyone purchasing this size TV.

I purchased the transmitter because I don't have an aux input in my car. The product works well.  I live in an area that is crowded with stations and the transmitter still provided a strong enough signal to override weak stations and provide near quality audio.

One review mentioned the Sansa player won't fit in the transmitter with the silicon case on. I use the silicon case to protect my player.  I took off the belt clip that comes with the case.  The player and case fits well enough in the transmitter.

This CD/DVD holder is sturdy and stylish.  I needed something to look nice, but hold my stuff, and those wallet-type options weren't really cutting it for me.  

I had also purchased something similiar (not Case Logic) from another store and was unimpressed by how flimsy it was.

I now have 4 or 5 of these and they look great all lined up.  I plan on getting more as needed.  When they get full, it still stays sturdy and fits in the holder (the other one I purchased ballooned out and had to be forced to get it in).

The only con I can think of is the price.  For me, it's worth it, but that may not be the case for you if there are budget constraints

I purchased this item on March 15 from Amazon. We've been using it for almost a month now. My wife and I have built our HT system in our Master bedroom (16x14x10) also have 40" Samsung LCD 4095 (1080p) and Polk audio speakers (in ceiling) LC60i for front and middle speakers and RC60i for the surround speakers. I'm awaiting for Toshiba HD-XA2 that was recently ordered to complement our system and would be replacing my current infinity  subwoofer with a HSU STF-2 sub.

Originally my first choice was a Pioneer VSX-1016 receiver but with lack of zone 2 and HDMI video pass-thru only. I didn't think it fit our needs. However, Onkyo TX-SR604b not only was a true bargain but it also exceeded my expectations, ease of use (very easy setup) user friendly powerful enough to drive all my polk speakers clean and crisp sound. I did'nt have any problem as far as clicking sound related to HDMI issues like few folks have mentioned on their reviews and I didn't mind running extra component cable to my TV knowing it doesn't up-convert component to HDMI. The only thing that I haven't tested it yet was the zone 2 feature. I'm planning to install my extra pair RC60i in wall speakers to our master bathroom hopefully soon so can't comment on that part yet.

Overall we're very pleased with our purchased Thanks AMAZON!

I've used everything from Ableton Live to ProTools to Reason and this thing is just plug and play.  Very easy interface makes for no brainer recording.  I'm a guitarist and the stock sound selections are outstanding.  Most players drive themselves crazy tweaking their sound but as you know it's all about the SONG.  The Sessions software is a piece of cake and makes it incredibly easy to go with your inspiration instead of getting sidetracked trying to figure out all the bells and whistles.  Fantastic product guys and for the money it's a steal

I had an Optoma H27 but felt it was lacking the brightness I liked on TV, and I heard that HD72 was much better.  So I returned my H27 to Costco and got the HD6800, which is Costco's version of the HD72.  Wow, "much better" hardly describes it!  The brightness is incredible, and the detail and colors are truly remarkable.  The other night, I was trying out different DVDs just to see what they looked like on the new system, and I was totally blown away.

While it does upscale DVD images to look better on its system, I also bought a Sony upscaling DVD player and there is a significant improvement with it with the HDMI connection.  I had read that since they are both upscaling, the DVD player's upscaling wouldn't be necessary, but I do find the image through the upscaling DVD the best in a side-by-side test using two Sony DVD players and two DVDs of the recently restored "Carousel" using component, s-video, and HDMI at the same time, all connected to the HD72.  I saw clearer detail on faces coming from the HDMI upscaling DVD player.  

I was so impressed, I felt like pulling in people from the street to see it, but I fought the impulse because I don't want to share it with anyone.  

With a little tweaking of the menus, new films like "Star Wars III" and "Sin City" showed incredible detail, and older films like "The Adventures of Robin Hood" were gorgeous in their Technicolor glory.

I highly recommend the HD72.

This is just great for a single VPU video card, the cooling system works great, moving all the hot air outside the CPU. The software overclock is good too, u can change values any time u want and u can select if u want those applied for 3D games only.
It works with any game, I've tested it with Oblivion at 1280x1024, HDR enabled and every option at maximum. It works great with F.E.A.R at 1280x1024 with AAx8 and FFA x 4
the price is good for a very high end video cards

Unless that I made an order for Terk Technologies Leapfrog LF-30S Wireless 2.4 GHz A/V Distribution System, I received another wireless system from TERK Co, but the point is that this system is working properly, and right now I'm able to have Greek TV via internet to my desktop, and via the TERK wireless system downstairs to my living-room TV appliance. During the operational time, I saw that I don't have good resolution. I don't know if the reason is because this distance between my office and my living-room (the office is above from the living-room - so there is no big distance at all).
But anyway, I will track this equipment, and if everything is ok I will buy one receiver more.

Thank you.

I have purchased over two dozen of these units. This is the best unit for the price. There are a few things that are a real plus one is the small screen on the unit. This allows you to be certain that your feed is being input. Also the card slots are a plus. Two things to be aware of. If you are using the unit in colder temperatures the unit will need to sit and warm up before use. Apparently there is some type of a dew sensor built in. Also if  you are transferring images from a card you have to look at the manual to determine what type of disc is required. Not a one disc does all unit

Works as billed.  I am currently playing a DVD+RL that would not play on any other player.  I have not purchased a 1080P LCD TV, but it is why I purchased an upconverting DVD player.  I have tried DVD+R and DVD+RW.  I will be trying audio formats later.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is waiting for the HD versus BlueRay to determine which will be the dominant technology and for its price to come down

I'm not a serious piano player, just casual.  Don't have room for a piano, so this serves my purposes.  I just want to entertain myself.  If I were a professional who played in public, not sure if this would be the ultimate keyboard, because it doesn't have a fullsize keyboard.  But for practicing and casual playing it's great!  It has more features than I will ever use

This is exactly what I was looking for: not too expensive, not much hassle with the cables - they are integrated with the unit, and no need to reach for the button to switch computers - simply press "Scroll Lock" twice to go from one computer to the other. 
Cables are pretty long, which is good: longer that I need at the moment, but I may appreciate the extra length in the future.

Great features with the Microsoft mouse.  Wanted at least a 4 button mouse so internet travel is much easier. Comes with a USB dongle that I did not want to use so I was determined to get this mouse working with the built-in Bluetooth in my new Dell Latitude notebook.  Found that the Toshiba drivers provided by Dell for the Bluetooth would not work with the Microsoft mouse.  Seems still some incompatibility with different manufactures of Bluetooth devices.  Go figure....  Had to delete the Toshiba drivers and let XP with SP-2 provide the drivers and it works great. 

Pros: Great features, no cord, long battery life between charges (days), very responsive.

Cons:  Some difficulty getting it to work without supplied dongle, bigger than I like to pack around for a notebook.

The Azden transmitter-receiver system has operated marvelously well for me over scores of interviews. As an aspiring video maker it was a product I should have bought a long time ago. 

Mine is the 9v-powered model, not the AA. But it has proven well-made, light and easy to use. 

There's something neat about micing people with a lavaliere unit. I find that they enjoy the attention of attaching the mic and the professional touch that it brings to the taping.  

Being able to range abut the room while taping and simultaneously retaining good audio is a remarkable experience. Another benefit of micing someone is that cuts way back on ambient noise. The din of voices surrounding your interview is a typical intrusion; using the lavaliere cuts out a great deal of the unwanted sonic information.

It works very well.  It's nice to be able to listen to CD's in my car without getting a whole new stereo system installed.  My only problem is that the CD player will turn off every once in a while when the power cord is bent.  This happens rarely, but it's enough to be a little annoying.  Other than that, it's a very nice product.  No skipping, easy to use and a fair price

This product has good and bad points. I listed some below:

Good
---------
Cheaper than Apple ($5 as compared to $30)
Works great
Small
Convienient

Bad
---------
Cheap (might not hold up long term)
No warranty coverage for your iPod is something goes wrong
Has to be plugged in upside down (for me anyway...)

Overall, I'm glad I bought this instead of Apple's version. The main factor for me was price, but if you have the money, get the Apple charger, simply because you'll be covered by warranty that way

I love this remote.
I was afraid that having a NON-TIVO brand unit (Toshiba brand TIVO unit) would require lots of setup (testing dozens of codes before finding the right one).

Mine worked just as soon as I put batteries into the unit.

The buttons are quite intuitive; I never used the user's manual yet.

A real winner.

An inexpensive replacement for the real unit

We installed this external HD on a Dell computer. As most Dell customers will attest to, any time you talk to one of their representatives, they'll deny compatability with anything other than a Dell product. Well, I have upgraded the video card, power supply, and now added this HD to the computer with very liitle effort. This HD has performed perfectly for us.

When I got my hands on the PMC-120 I thought this was going to to be the best player but when I started to play with it all the glitches started to come into my way.
I agree with the other reviews that it has a first generation-device feel to it. 
MUSIC:
When I tried to put music in my PMC it syncronized  my mp3s with the WMP 10 with no problem (very fast). If U are looking for a grab and drop (copy/paste) your music mp3 device, this is not for you because when I did  it got everything in one same folder that read "Unknown artist and album". So you have to put all your mp3s via WMP 10, wich is no problem for me because it does it very fast. The problems that I encountered is that it only has one "Portable playlist"  and sometimes when Im playing an mp3 and navegating through the other albums the controls respond 1 to 2 seconds later after pushing the button.
One cool thing is that it shows the cd covers  without having to put them in. This is done via the WMP10.
The sound is very good and crisp, and the equalizer setups are fair.But you defenetly cant tell the difference between the diffrent eq setups with the built in speacker wich has a very small horrible sound.

PICTURES:
This is basically a grab and drop procedure to get your pics in the device and you can arrenge them in folders or subfolders. You can not transfer directly from your camera so if you are travelling and dont have a PC to transfer your pics this little baby wont do that job for you.

VIDEO:
Ok, now this is where it starts to get frustrating for me...
I wanted a portable media device that I would only grab and drop my movies that are divx and xvid.  I knew that this device only reads WMV but it "supports" DIVX, XVID, MPEG, etc. This "support" deppends on what the WMP10 can play. So this means that you sincronyze (via WMP10) your movies no matter the format and it converts them into WMP movies and at the same time it just transferes it and fits it into your PMC secreen size.  I had this in mind when I bought it and was fine with me untill I tried it the first time: The WMP10 wouldnt convert my XVID movies and after a few hours of trial and error and surfing the web my problem was that I had to have the correct video codecs that are compatibles with the WMP10. So after uninstalling and installing I was good to go so I converted a 1:45hr long movie in only 25 minutes.  But this short moment of joy  was suddenly interrupted by the fact that the WMP10 fits the widescreen movies into the PMC and makes all the images long and thin almost unwatchable!!!! You cant change this because the WMP does this automatically.  My answer was using other software and converting my widescreen movies into WMV files. The problem is that it takes almost the running time of the movies to convert...I have tried a lot of different softwares and still havent found one that does it faster as the WMP10.
In the other hand if you have a full screen video you just use the WMP10 and it does it very fast and with good quality.
You can connect your device to the tv but the resolution is very low so I think this option is useless on the PMC.

So the veredict is: The PMC-120 is a good  multimedia player with minor glitches. It is a little bulky but personally I think the size is not that big. I think the good side of the size issue comes along with its  big 3.6 inch screen wich is great to watch films and this for me kicks arse compared to the ipod video. 
If you want to play directly your DIVX or XVID movies on your player buy another porduct like the iRiver PMP series or the Archos players wich are way, way, WAY more expensive.
So I think that for the price and for what it does the PMC-120 gets two thumbs up.

I bought this because it had got good reviews on here and the price was low enough for it not to pain me! So far it does what it's suppose to do.  I am pleased. It's a little clunky, and it looks awful when the anteni are fully extended. We'll see how it works in 6 months

I am kind of a shortwave junkie, and have a few radios all over the place,
I must admit that for the money spent, and the performance and endurance, this little bugger is probably my best buy!  I cannot believe the sound quality or the reception, its phenominal!  I can pick up shortwave inside the meat packing plant where I work!  (Big heavy steel freezers) It is a simple, small no frills, pocket size radio, but it blows away anything in its price range, trust me

Same HP burner/player that is $30 or more in the local stores.

Installation was fast and easy.

Nero software installed fast, very little info on the Nero products,
to play dvd you need to install the Cyber DVD player on the Nero disk.

I travel overseas a lot for my job. This little power strip is compact and enables you to keep ONE adapter on the end of it to plug into the funky wall plug and then use your "normal" plugs for operating four devices. Most Monster products are terribly overpriced and not worth the money (wires, cables, etc.) but this gizmo rocks

I picked this up to use on a Mediterranean cruise since the outlets in cruise ship cabins are scarce and usually located right at the edge of a vanity.  It worked great for charging 2 digital camera batteries which wouldn't fit in the normal outlet at the same time.  It's small, rugged and light so it's easy to pack

I don't know what the fuss is all about about this unit's "fan noise"... After the firmware update, if one bothers to do o it, the fan noise level is really trivial compared to advantages of HUGE storage space (or data redundancy if one should choose to use RAID 1). The sound of the fan is about as loud as a fan from a PC workstation (one of those DELL Precisions or MacPro/PowerMacs).

One of the things I wish could be different about the unit is if the RAID configuration could be more easily managed by using Apple's Disk Utility instead of using WD's own proprietary software (which requires a reboot... an annoying thing on Mac OSX.4 which I almost NEVER EVER have to reboot). And then the button manager requires yet another reboot before the functionality can be fully utilized... HELLO, Western Digital... Mac is no Microsoft Windows where users are used to rebooting often! If you want more of Mac users' business, write your apps like a true OSX app... At most I should be able to just log out and then log back in to use the functionalities... 

Other than that, the unit is a work horse. I use SuperDuper to backup my Mac and so far have had no issues at all with it...

I bought this drive from PCuniverse on Amazon and I am generally happy with the service I received and product quality, I have not used it for long time yet but have managed to fill up most of the drive. The speed looks good even over wireless network. I also like the Truecrypt encryption software bundled which is actually freeware; seems to be quite capable an usable with any drive (USB flash or disk drive, look at [...]It seems much better than the software that comes with many flashdrive in terms of capabilities. I am surprised that there is not a lot of competition in the 8GB flash business yet possibly because people don't need it. I had a Corsair 1GB drive from 2 years back and it worked quite well; upgraded to 8GB as my data requirement grew

This watch is great because the countdown is so easy to use.  Whenever I need to remember to check the dryer or the stove, all I have to do is push one button to the number of minutes I want to wait.  Its the only watch I wear and I never take it off.  I even swim with it on.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it is so plain.  I wish Casio would make it in a pretty color

Great product that works exactly as described. I have not used this as a stand-alone label maker; I've only used it with my computer. The software is fairly easy to use, and it will pull data from an Excel spreadsheet, which is a definite plus. I had a spreadsheet of over 300 items for which I needed to make labels, and linking to the Excel doc made the process very quick and convenient. The only complaint I have is that the tape for the label maker is rather pricey. I spent $40 on the label maker, and so far I've spent $60 on tape

I have multiple cameras, and one of my favorite features is that this reader can support multiple types of cards plugged in at one time.  If you have a SD card and a CF card, both can be inserted and read/written to without having to switch out the cards.  Very nice reader for a great price.  

The Blue LED is very pleasant to look at.

I would give this 5 stars but for a few things:

- the included earbuds are uncomfortable and fall out of my ears during
  exercise
- syncing is sometimes buggy
- you have to load all podcasts manually
- podcasts seem to be ordered by date on the player, no matter how you
  arrange them in iTunes

Recent releases of iTunes have solved some, but not all, of the sync issues. Also, I have read about some workarounds for the podcast ordering problem, but they involve rebuilding your library, and furthermore from what I've read they're just temporary fixes. Apple needs to fix this.

Still, the small form factor, cool design, and easy-to-use controls make this a great product. I sold my 4G 40GB iPod right after I got this, and I have no regrets.

This card is significantly cheaper (at the time I ordered) than the Sandisk Extreme III at the same speed (133x).  I was expecting to receive a 100x since it was listed as that in the description but the 133x came and I was very happy.  Works as advertised and Kingston is a reliable memory brand.  Product came quickly

The design for this headset is ingenious. Every piece is separated so you can mix and match for your convenience. It's not really a headset, but a headphone with a detachable headset; so you can use it to chat online or listen to your mp3 player. The microphone can even be mounted independently onto your computer monitor with the included base. The extension cord comes with a volume controller, another very convenient feature. There are also little hangers on the extension cord, which are for attaching the microphone cord. The audio quality is pretty good, throw in 20 bucks more to get the combo set, which includes a sound card to enhance the audio quality.
****The only thing I have to complain about is the comfort issue. Maybe it's the size of my head, but the earpieces simply press a little bit too hard against my temples, so it causes mild headache after 30 minutes of usage. Other than that, this headset is perfect

I'm so technically challenged, and I had no trouble figuring out this system.  I already had the base unit and had to search for these handsets to go with it. Altogether they were a bit pricey, but worth every penny!  Very easy to understand the directions, and lots of bells and whistles.  Lots of cool ring tones and features that are not listed on the product description.  I love the intercom features, they are great for when the kids are upstairs, I don't have to yell for them to come down or go upstairs to talk to them.  Very cool

I couldn't believe how lightweight this monitor is, and how easy it was to connect to my computer. It is one of the best investments I have made this year. What a difference the LCD screen makes for my vision. Its wonderful.  I highly recommend this monitor to anyone who is looking for something easy to connect and have excellent quality as well. It is the perfect monitor for me

This watch is not only the best watch I have ever owned, it is the only day time watch that I ever use.  I love the 1,3,5,10,20, 30 minute timer found ONLY on this watch.  I love it so much that I buy several and change out the band to match different outfits!  I do wish that this watch came in a more dressy version.  I also hope that Casio continues to make this watch for people who need a timer and a dependable alarm

I bought this deck about 6 months ago. It has performed flawless in every aspect. As soon as I turned it on I could notice a big difference in the sound quality from my old poineer deck. I have taken all of my cd's out of my truck because there is no need for the cd player if you take advantage of the ipod interface. The ipod function is flawless and easy to use. Just plug in your ipod and search by artist, album, song title or playlist. This can get a little tricky while driving ecpecially if you have a large library so I would suggest using playlists. The output of sound quality from an ipod is amazing. Also there is a very useful bass engine that is very useful if you have subs, this function allows for flawless bass output and easy ajustment. This deck is the best overall I have ever listened to

I've had this printer for four years. I print approximately 25 documents each week. This is the first time that I have had to replace the cartridge. It's a great little printer and this cartridge lasts a good long time, too. Compared to ink jet printers that I have had, I get about 5 times as many prints from this laserjet -- and the price of the cartridges is about the same as the ink jets.

Great buy

Firstoff, that first review about the format capacities is outright wrong.  Let me explain how this works.

The soundstage program that the player uses is a lot like iTunes; it has its own proprietary format that is really just MP3 with a different file extension title.  When you import your MP3s into the soundstage library, it makes its own DUPLICATE library of your music in a new directory using its 'OMG' file suffix.  Yes, OMG.  I think that's funny, and you should too.

The minidiscs themselves are essentially just CD-RWs.  Keep this in mind.  They are enjoyable cheap to buy more, they are rewritable, and they hold 80 minutes of basic cd-audio, or close to 4/5 hours of 'low bitrate' audio, which is just compressed MP3s.  

The product itself is very good.  I've had one for a short while.  I bought an eight-pack of disks right after I got it, and filled them with music.  I have six full discs of labeled artists and find that disc-swapping of five-hour playlists is FAR less irritating than my old cd-player method; CD-swapping with 70-minute albums.  

The controls are VERY simple and effective.  Grouping your tracks makes them easier to navigate, but you can otherwise go through all the tracks you have as if it were an audio-CD.  Its impeccably shockproof, and my only severe grievance is the lack of a backlight.  The hold switch works fine and the unit is small and light.

I got this as an alternative to harddrive MP3 jukeboxes.  Most MP3 players over a gig in capacity are HD storage, which is far less durable (in my experience) than simpler players.  Rather than settle for a 256 or 512 mb player that I would have to swap on my computer constantly, I got the minidisc player and can simply take other disks with me.  Its a solution that suited me well

I've owned 2 sets of these types of phone systems.  A GE set and a 2.4 gig Uniden set.  

This is by far the best.  Actually, it's perfect.  No noise on the line at all.  Everything just works perfectly.

Only one caution. This particular model does not have an answering machine.  I was moving too fast when i bought and thought that it did.  If you want an answering machine to come with, make sure you buy the right model.  

I'm totally sold on the DECT 6.0!!!!

Buy it.  You won't regret it.

I recently bought and installed this radio in my truck, and I have not had any problems yet!!!  A few minor details are the noise blanker seems really sesitive (sometimes when it is on I do not receive any traffic) but that is about it.  I enjoy Cobra products, this is my second radio (I just traded up from a 25NWXT), I have a Cobra HG2000 Antenna, and I am waiting on a Cobra Mic for my radio.  So far no problems with any of it and I hope to have none down the road!!!!

I've had my Cobra 29 for over five years now. It's been in four different trucks, and traveled over 500,000 miles with me. Once I added two wilson antennas and a power mic, I can get out over four miles on a good night. My personal record is a line of sight 130 miles from a mountainside. I love it. I was thinking of getting a galaxy, but why? I have a great radio here

    After doing some research and owning a cheaper shredder model,  I decided to purchase this shredder.  So far it was a wise decision.  I have seen it elsewhere for a lot more money.  I have been using it to shred up all my old and new personal documents and it is awesome.  I put a kitchen garbage bag in the can and it keeps all the little paper pieces contained within the bag, and I can just keep reusing the same bag. It really is a smooth shredder and it keeps on working, no jams, etc.  Great Buy!

I went from the first version of the Audigy2 to this. And it did increase my performace a tiny bit. My old card was going out on me. A lot of pops and clicks and games locking up with sound skipping. Haven't had any of that yet. :)

I also didn't seem to have the MB problems that were stated in first review. I have a ASRock Dual-VSTA(new one made for Windows:Vista).

With a good Stereo setup this card sounds really nice. I have a older but really nice 5.1 with 100watts for each speaker. Only 4 years old, but have seen some really nice ones lately.

A lot of new games coming out have intense sound now. Vanguards sound has crappy options so you can't dumb it down and it can drag a system down, esp one using on board sound.

I would give this a 4 or even 3 star rating if it included Amazons rating too. [...

FANTASTIC sound for the money!  (seems to work well with Asus P5W DH, anyway)  Nice crisp highs, decent mid-range and unmuddied lows make this an excellent pick, IMO.  The only down-side I could find is some of the nonsense-software included is, well, nonsense.  
Creative scores, again

Buying an equalizer seems kind of retro these days, but I still have a good cassette dual deck and have recently purchased a reel to reel again.Used to have one years ago...now use both of these for fun and the occassional uploading of music from the old formats to my media center computer.The equalizer acts as a hook up device to have both decks on my stereo which is then hooked to my computer.It allows for some sound enhancing along with the computer

I use this scanner primarily for text documents and couldn't be more impressed.  You do need text software - I have Textbridge - but I find relatively few errors in the scan, proofreading and corrections are easy and efficient.  Best of all, I don't have another device plugged into my computer or taking up space on my desk.  Caution - I haven't used it for photos, but it does a great job on text
